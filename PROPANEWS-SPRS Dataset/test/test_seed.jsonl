'' \\nAli Suleiman Aujali , the Libyan ambassador to the U.S. who broke with the Libyan government over the use of force against protesters , told CNN 's Wolf Blitzer that his people were being `` slaughtered like sheep '' and the international community needed to step in -- or else stop encouraging the uprising . \\nShould US arm Libyan rebels ? \\nJohn McCain pushes Libya no-fly zone `` They have to dominate the skies , they have to stop the march of the tanks towards Misrata and towards Tripoli , '' he said . \\n`` They have to take measures to stop these massacres going on in my country . \\nIf you ca n't act now , then do n't encourage us to die . '' \\nJohn Bellinger , a former legal adviser to the U.S. State Department , told CNN , `` Legally , there is no authority for the United States or any other country to do that under international law unless authorized by the Security Council . \\n`` Politically it could be quite problematic ... for the United States or NATO to begin shooting down Libyan aircraft , even in the face of the things that Gadhafi is doing against his own nationals . '' \\nWhat role does the United Nations play ? \\nThe United Nations Security Council has already taken some action against the Gadhafi regime , but it has not authorized the use of armed force . \\nIts members met at the weekend and voted unanimously for sanctions , including an arms embargo , assets freeze , and a travel ban for Gadhafi , his family , and key associates . \\nHowever , they did not support calls for a no-fly-zone , and any decision on whether to impose one is likely to have to wait for a further U.N. resolution . \\nIf the U.N. did vote in favor of a no-fly-zone , NATO would likely play some role in enforcing it , but NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen insists no action could be taken without a U.N. mandate . \\n`` A no-fly-zone is not a part of the U.N. Security Council resolution , and a far-reaching approach like that would require a U.N. Security Council mandate , '' he told CNN . \\n`` It 's a hypothetical question at this stage , but if the issue is raised , and if there is a request -LRB- for cooperation -RRB- then the NATO council will consider it , but that 's not the case for the time being . \\n`` We have started preparations for all eventualities , but I think it is a bit premature to outline any timeline . '' \\nIs Italy 's decision to suspend its non-aggression pact significant ? \\nIf any military action , such as enforcing a no-fly-zone , were to be taken , troops would likely have to use air bases in Italy . \\nItaly is also home to the U.S. Navy 's Sixth Fleet . \\nUnder a friendship treaty , signed three years ago by Gadhafi and Italian PM Silvio Berlusconi , Italy agreed to pay Libya compensation for its colonial rule of the country , and Libya pledged to help stem the tide of refugees heading for Italy from its shores . \\nBut the pact also included a non-aggression clause , under which Italy promised not to allow its territories to be used to launch military operations against Libya . \\nThe treaty was suspended over the weekend . \\nWhat happens to Libya after Gadhafi ? \\nExplain it to me : Libya unrest Possible military aid to Libya Explain it to me : Libya unrest Kurt Volker , a former U.S. ambassador to NATO , told CNN that Italy 's suspension of the pact would not immediately enable military operations to be launched from that country . \\n`` If you 're really trying to think about military action , do you have some kind of authorization to do so ? \\nYou would need a U.N. mandate and possibly a NATO declaration or both , and there is n't anything like that on the table at the moment , '' he said . \\nAldo Amati , deputy press secretary for the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs , insisted the treaty had not been suspended to pave the way for military action . \\n`` There 's no connection , '' he told CNN . \\n`` There 's no link between the two things . '' \\nWhat about sanctions against the Gadhafi regime ? \\nGadhafi is no stranger to sanctions : He was subject to them for many years following Libya 's refusal to hand over suspects in the bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 over Lockerbie in 1988 , in which 270 people were killed . \\nThis time around though , the international community has taken further action , freezing the Libyan leader 's assets and those of his family and the regime . \\nThe U.S. alone has blocked access to at least $ 30 billion in Libyan government assets , the largest amount ever blocked under a sanctions program . \\nTravel bans too are likely to impact the Gadhafi family 's jet-setting lifestyle . \\nWhat will the U.S. do ? \\nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton insists that : `` Nothing is off the table , so long as the Libyan government continues to threaten and kill Libyan citizens . '' \\nHowever , analysts say it seems unlikely that that the U.S. would launch attacks on Libya without a U.N. mandate . \\nRosemary Hollis , Professor of Middle East Policy Studies at City University London , said : `` The messy fact of Afghanistan and Iraq has been to deter any kind of gung-ho notion that you can sort our any very foreign country by force . '' \\nBut some prominent figures have called for other forms of military action to be taken - and quickly . \\nSenator John McCain -LRB- R-Arizona -RRB- is one of those urging the introduction of a no-fly-zone : `` Libyan pilots are n't going to fly if there 's a no-fly-zone .

with the co-chairmen of an independent commission investigating the spill , while Attorney General Eric Holder was headed to the Gulf Coast to meet with state attorneys general . \\nOn Monday afternoon , the living quarters on the flotel sat empty . \\nGenerators pumped in cool air and powered the lights , and at the foot of each bunk sat a towel , washcloth and individually wrapped bar of soap . \\nIf necessary , four tents on dry land nearby can house 500 more workers . \\nWorkers will likely be trucked in on the two-lane state road . \\nThe accommodations on the barge are Spartan , but comfortable -- similar to military barracks . \\nEach pod contains 12 bunks , with a bathroom for every four . \\nPer Coast Guard standards , each resident gets 30 square feet of space in the quarters . \\nThe barge has 10 washers , 10 dryers and a kitchen , although food will be served in a tent on land . \\nThe quarters are typically floated alongside offshore oil rigs to supplement housing on the drilling operations . \\nThe flotel could be moved if significant amounts of oil wash up at another location . \\nAnother flotel sits about 15 miles away , off Grand Isle , and BP plans to establish them elsewhere along the coast . \\nPort Fourchon and Grand Isle were quiet Monday , with only a handful of people seen walking on the beaches by an Associated Press reporter and photographer flying over in a helicopter . \\nBP is hiring local workers and ones from other states , and Link acknowledged that some from Louisiana might prefer a long drive home each to staying on the flotel . \\nFor Chad Martin , co-owner of Martin Quarters , business is booming . \\nHis company has 200 living quarters , and 60 were available when a BP subcontractor called . \\nThe oil giant rented every single one . \\nBut Martin understands the gravity of the situation . \\n`` This is not the way to get work , '' he said Cleanup efforts are being ramped up while BP also tries the latest in a series of patchwork fixes , this one a cut-and-cap process to put a lid on the leaking wellhead so oil can be siphoned to the surface . \\nThe risky procedure could , at least temporarily , increase the oil flowing from the busted well . \\nUsing robot submarines , BP plans to cut away the riser pipe this week and place a cap-like containment valve over the blowout preventer . \\nOn Monday , live video feeds showed robot submarines moving equipment around and using a circular saw-like device to cut small pipes at the bottom of the Gulf . \\nBP failed to plug the leak Saturday with its top kill , which shot mud and pieces of rubber into the well but could n't beat back the pressure of the oil . \\nThe oil company also announced plans Monday to try attaching another pipe to a separate opening on the blowout preventer with some of the same equipment used to pump in mud during the top kill . \\nThe company also wants to build a new freestanding riser to carry oil toward the surface , which would give it more flexibility to disconnect and then reconnect containment pipes if a hurricane passed through . \\nNeither of those plans would start before mid-June and would supplement the cut-and-cap effort . \\nBut the best chances for sealing off the leak are two relief wells , the first of which wo n't be ready until August . \\nThe spill has already leaked between 19.7 million and 43 million gallons , according to government estimates . \\nFor the relief well to succeed , the bore hole must precisely intersect the damaged well , which experts have compared to hitting a target the size of a dinner plate more than two miles into the earth . \\nIf it misses , BP will have to back up its drill , plug the hole it just created , and try again . \\n`` The probability of them hitting it on the very first shot is virtually nil , '' said David Rensink , incoming president of the American Association of Petroleum Geologists , who spent most of his 39 years in the oil industry in offshore exploration . \\n`` If they get it on the first three or four shots they 'd be very lucky . '' \\nThe trial-and-error process could take weeks , but it will eventually work , scientists and BP said . \\nThen engineers will then pump mud and cement through pipes to ultimately seal the well . \\nOn the slim chance the relief well does n't work , scientists were n't sure exactly how much -- or how long -- the oil would flow . \\nThe gusher would continue until the well bore hole collapsed or pressure in the reservoir dropped to a point where oil was no longer pushed to the surface , said Tad Patzek , chair of the Petroleum and Geosystems Engineering Department at the University of Texas-Austin . \\nBP said it does n't know how much oil is in the reservoir because it was starting to collect and analyze data on its size when the rig exploded April 20 . \\nIn Patzek 's mind , failing to get the relief wells to work is n't an option . \\n`` I do n't admit the possibility of it not working , '' he said .

'' \\nThis , he said , should be done within three to four weeks . \\nBut it may be at least four to five months before a vaccine is ready . \\nClearly , if you make a swine flu vaccine and the pandemic does n't actually occur , we could end up with no seasonal flu vaccine Safety is - unsurprisingly - paramount , as vaccines can often be worse than the disease they are trying to combat . \\nAn outbreak of swine flu in 1976 infected 200 people in the US . \\nOnly one of them died , but a vaccine administered to 40m people killed 25 and led to 500 others developing Guillain-Barre syndrome , which can be fatal . \\nFor those countries now entering the summer months with the flu season behind them , a delay in vaccine is not a real cause for concern . \\nBut in the southern hemisphere where countries are entering their winter months the picture would be different if the outbreak were to worsen . \\nOne way of administering the vaccine could be by adding a swine flu component to the seasonal flu jab given out in the autumn . \\nBut while production facilities are much more extensive than they once were , it could still take several years to produce enough swine vaccine to match global demand if the virus continues to spread and becomes more virulent . \\nAnd in the rush to combat swine flu - from which there have been fewer than 10 confirmed deaths - manufacturers still have to keep their eye on producing an effective vaccine for seasonal flu as they do every year . \\nIn the US alone there are an estimated 25-50 million cases reported each year . \\nThese result in 150,000 hospitalisations and 30,000 to 40,000 deaths . \\nWorldwide there may be as many as half a million deaths each year . \\n`` Clearly , if you make a swine flu vaccine and the pandemic does n't actually occur , we could end up with no seasonal flu vaccine , '' warned Chris Viehbacher , chief executive officer of Sanofi-Aventis . \\nIn any event , swine flu appears to be responding well to anti-viral treatments like Tamiflu and Relenza . \\nThese drugs do not attack the virus itself but an enzyme that allows it to spread within the body . \\nTaken promptly , they can reduce the severity and length of the illness . \\nBut production of sufficient quantities - were they needed - could again be problematic , although pharmaceutical giants GlaxoSmithKline Plc and Roche Holding AG have both said they are stepping up production .

there is no other explanation , '' neighbor Atiya Mohamed shouted as he stood among the rubble that was Marabit 's home . \\nYet NATO and the rebels hoping to seize Zlitan and eventually capture the fortified capital will likely portray it as more evidence of Gaddafi stationing civilians at military sites as he seeks to avoid further damage to his fighting prowess . \\nThe Gaddafi government routinely reports deaths inflicted by NATO airstrikes , whose victims it calls ` martyrs , ' but Thursday 's events marked the first time in weeks officials had offered details of the identities of those it said were killed by NATO bombs . \\nIt was also the first time in weeks it had offered journalists an opportunity to report on human victims of airstrikes at close range . \\nAfter the attack , NATO acknowledged it had hit a military command site in the area around 6:30 a.m. , approximately the time officials and neighbors said Marabit 's house was struck . \\n`` We always take seriously allegations of civilian casualties and are looking into it , but we have no evidence at this stage that this was caused by an air strike , '' a NATO official in Naples said . \\nWhile there was no evidence of any military activity among the shattered cinderblock and cushions strewn around Marabit 's destroyed home , rebels fighting for control of Zlitan raised questions about the building 's true use . \\nIf confirmed , the attack near Zlitan would not be the first time since Western-led airstrikes began in Libya in late March that NATO activity has resulted in civilian deaths . \\nIn June , NATO admitted it destroyed a house in Tripoli in which Libyan officials said nine civilians were killed . \\nShortly afterwards , the Libyan government reported almost 20 people were killed in a strike on the home of a member of Libya 's 12-strong Revolutionary Command Council , led by Gaddafi . \\nMore such incidents could undermine support for a campaign already on shaky ground in some NATO nations , where financial pressures have added to doubts about a campaign that has yet to bring peace in Libya . \\nLibyan government spokesman Moussa Ibrahim said the incident would stoke anti-Western rage . \\n`` What NATO is doing is very dangerous . \\nIt is planting the seeds of hatred in the hearts of millions of Libyans , '' he said . \\nResidents of Zlitan and Souq al-Jumaa , on the town 's western outskirts , brushed aside rebel claims this week Gaddafi 's opponents were on the cusp of capturing the town . \\nZlitan was quiet as foreign journalists toured the center of the town on Thursday afternoon , as fasting Muslims rested or stayed indoors due to the heat . \\nBut the silence was interrupted regularly by the thuds of shelling or rocket attacks just to the east . \\nGovernment minders took journalists to see several other sites apparently hit by NATO strikes , including a large school and the local law college , where among rubble and law books lay empty ammunition boxes and green military clothing in the dirt . \\nMohamed Salim , minding a deserted toy store , said some Zlitan residents had fled and power cuts had become more frequent as fighting had increased in the past few weeks . \\nBut he said he was n't afraid of the advance of rebels . \\n`` I only fear god , '' he said . \\n-LRB- Editing by Douglas Hamilton and Sophie Hares -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "The blizzard in the U.S. Northeast gave way to a tornado in the South, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.", "prop_score_1": 0.5, "generate_explanation_1": "In this rewritten sentence, I have changed the location of the storm from the Northeast to the South, as the article originally stated that a tornado struck in the South after the blizzard in the Northeast.

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon to accuse him of `` losing all sense of humanity . '' \\nFrench Foreign Minister Alain Juppe warned Assad last month that the `` barbaric repression '' in Syria would `` end with the fall of the regime , '' and even ally Russia said he risked a `` sad fate '' unless he ended the violence and implemented reforms . \\n`` If he just defiantly continues to defy signals from the Arab world and international community it 's increasingly grim for him , '' said Rami Khouri , a Beirut-based Middle East analyst . \\nJust weeks before the uprising erupted in March , the 46-year-old leader said Syria was immune from the rebellions which have overthrown the leaders of Tunisia , Egypt and Libya because its foreign policy was closely aligned with popular Arab sentiment . \\nIn a speech at Damascus University in June , one of just a handful of addresses he has made since the unrest began , Assad justified the crackdown and said he was overwhelmed with support from Syrians he had met to discuss the crisis . \\n`` The love I felt from those people who represent most of the Syrian people is something I have never felt at any stage of my life , '' he said . \\nIn fact the unrest has polarized Syria . \\nMany demonstrators now openly chant for Assad 's execution -- a scene unimaginable eight months ago -- but he is still able to rally huge crowds for state-organized demonstrations and retains a core of support particularly among minority Christians and his own Alawite sect . \\nAlongside the military campaign against protests , Assad has lifted a state of emergency in place for nearly 50 years , approved laws to allow parties other than his ruling Baath Party to be established , and promised dialogue with the opposition . \\nThe characteristically ambiguous stance , mixing iron-fisted security while holding out the promise of change , helped to mute international criticism in the early stages of the uprising . \\nBut critics said his decision to send troops into several cities in the Muslim holy month of Ramadan four months ago showed he had chosen the `` security option '' to crush the protests rather than address their grievances . \\nTall and softly spoken Assad was thrust into the spotlight after the death of his elder brother Basel in a car crash in 1994 . \\nCalled back from medical studies in London , he gradually assumed a higher profile and six years later inherited the presidency when his father died after ruling Syria for 30 years . \\nTo allow the 34-year-old to assume power , Syria 's parliament met hastily to amend a constitutional clause requiring the president to be at least 40 years old . \\nIn office , he held out the prospect of reforming one of the Arab world 's most tightly controlled states and oversaw a short-lived move toward political freedoms before his `` Damascus Spring '' faded amid a wave of repression and arrests . \\nAssad also strengthened his father 's strategic alliance with Iran and supported militant Islamist groups including the Palestinian Hamas and the Lebanese Shi'ite group Hezbollah . \\nHe ended nearly three decades of Syrian military presence in neighboring Lebanon under international pressure following the 2005 assassination of Lebanese statesman Rafik al-Hariri . \\nBut the collapse in January of Beirut 's pro-Western government , led by Hariri 's son , was the latest sign that Assad had clawed back influence in Lebanon , one of only two countries to oppose Saturday 's Arab League move . \\nAlthough he backs anti-Israel militants , he also pursued indirect peace talks with Israel and , despite continued Israeli occupation of the Golan Heights captured from Syria in the 1967 Arab-Israeli war , ensured the front line usually remained quiet . \\nAt home he started liberalizing the economy , easing decades of central control and allowing limited foreign investment . \\nBut while those around him , including his cousin Rami Makhlouf , acquired great wealth , ordinary Syrians saw few benefits . \\nHe also maintained the grip on power held by his family and Alawite sect in the mainly Sunni Muslim state . \\nHis brother Maher commands the Republican Guard and is the second most powerful man in the country while brother-in-law Assef Shawkat is deputy chief-of-staff of the armed forces . \\nAssad 's wife Asma , who grew up in London and worked at an investment bank , helped him try to project a softer , liberal and modern image to the outside world , countering Syria 's reputation as a repressive police state . \\nHe insists that he remains in touch with his people even after a decade in power and eight months of trying to crush a determined uprising . \\n`` I live a normal life . \\nI drive my own car , we have neighbors , I take my kids to school , '' he told the British Sunday Telegraph newspaper last month . \\n`` That 's why I am popular .

' . \\nThe eastern part of his army melted away immediately , and over eight months the rest progressively disintegrated to leave a rump of loyal , family-led units . \\nThirty years ago to this month , President Hafez al-Assad of Syria ordered his elite forces to level the city of Hama in response to a surging Islamist rebellion . \\nOnly one brigade defected . \\nThomas Friedman - in his book From Beirut to Jerusalem - called this decisive brutality `` Hama rules '' . \\nHafez 's successor and son , President Bashar al-Assad , is operating under `` Homs rules '' - neither those of Libya last year , nor Hama a generation ago . \\nMr Assad 's security forces have been predictably resilient . \\nA regime built around the Alawite sect has stacked its officer corps with co-religionists , fellow tribesmen , and family members . \\nThe 4th Mechanised Division , which recently scrambled to regain control of Damascus ' suburbs , is drawn entirely from that sect . \\nSo too is the Republican Guard and influential air force intelligence . \\nThe Shabiha , an Alawite militia , has also been a useful auxiliary . \\nIn short , Syria 's military has been turned into a ruthless confessional militia that is likely to see little future in a post-Assad Syria . \\nAt the same time , no army can withstand stresses of this intensity and duration without suffering problems of morale , integrity and loyalty . \\nThe country 's demography means that only Sunni conscripts can fill up the rank-and-file . \\nAlthough the regime has sought to limit their role in combat , a steady trickle of defections has been unavoidable . \\nThe military opposition 's commander Col Riad al-Assad , based in southern Turkey , claims to command 40,000 soldiers in his Free Syrian Army -LRB- FSA -RRB- . \\nGen Mustafa al-Sheikh , the highest-ranking defector so far , has estimated the regime 's combat readiness as having fallen to `` 40 % for hardware and 32 % for personnel '' . \\nHe argues that there is a grave shortage of manpower , that Sunni officers have fled or been removed , and that large parts of the army are secretly reaching out the FSA to defect . \\nGen Sheikh , who has formed his own Higher Revolutionary Council to supersede the FSA , boldly predicts that `` the army will collapse during February '' . \\nThat timeline is highly improbable . \\nIt is as much an effort to garner international support and induce further defections , as it is an objective assessment of regime capabilities . \\nEven if defections are as numerous as the opposition claims , that would still leave the ratio of government-to-rebel forces as more than four-to-one - a margin of superiority exceeding that seen in Libya , supplemented by militias , and with airpower held largely in reserve . \\nAt the same time , President Assad 's force long ago passed the point at which they could hope for a final , decisive assault like that of Assad senior at Hama in 1982 . \\nThe most important factor is the deepening and widening of the uprising over recent months . \\nThose once wedded to peaceful protest now judge that taking up arms is the only viable option . \\nOne important milestone has been the outbreak of violence this month in Syria 's second city , Aleppo . \\nThe army is increasingly stretched across fronts that it did not have to worry about last year . \\nIt took days to regain control of suburbs around Damascus , and the town of Zabadani - scarcely 20 miles -LRB- 32km -RRB- north-west of Damascus - was entirely seized by rebels last month . \\nThese growing commitments thin out , and increase the strain on , loyal units . \\nThe paradox is that more fighting means more defections , but failing to do so risks conceding territory on which the armed parts of the opposition can regroup and consolidate . \\nMr Assad 's security forces do retain some advantages . \\nLibya taught us that rebel control of territory can be tenuous and easily reversible . \\nIndeed , Zabadani is falling back into regime hands . \\nMoreover , the external support to Damascus outstrips anything that might be flowing to the FSA from Turkey , Saudi Arabia or Qatar . \\nRussia has already sent tons of ammunition , and this lifeline is expected to remain open . \\nGen Qassem Suleimani , commander of the elite Quds Force of Iran 's Revolutionary Guard Corps -LRB- IRGC -RRB- , has reportedly served as `` chief regime adviser and strategist '' . \\nThe Guardian reports that he `` has taken up a spot in the war room '' alongside President Assad and his ruling clique . \\nThere is also diplomatic succor . \\nRegimes can hold together or fall apart based on perceptions . \\nRussia 's angry veto of the modest UN resolution last week sent a powerful signal to those Syrian senior officers of wavering loyalty - Moscow is committed to preserving the regime in some form . \\nIt is rational for officials and groups hitherto sitting on the fence to adjust their loyalty in line with Russia 's apparent commitment . \\nOne hope is that even if President Assad is squeezed out , a Yemen-style stage-managed transition keeps the `` guts '' of the regime in place . \\nSome vulnerable minorities who see Assad as guarantor of their safety , have compelling reasons to take a gamble on this outcome . \\nA secret US diplomatic cable from Damascus in 2006 observed `` tremendous fear in the Alawite community about retribution if the Sunni majority ever regains power '' . \\nAssad 's `` Homs rules '' mean that he has no strategy , only tactics : indiscriminate bombardment of a fragmented opposition , the sharpening of sectarian loyalty to force minority communities to pick sides , and outreach to foreign patrons with a stake in his survival . \\nIt is hard to see how this can do anything but accelerate the militarisation of the opposition , induce greater countervailing help to the rebels from frustrated outsiders , and make it very hard for any pluralistic , democratic settlement to emerge from the wreckage .

'' \\nHomegrown amnesty , truth and reconciliation processes -- rather than international prosecutions -- have been key to the resolution of several political crises or conflicts once thought intractable , such as the conflict between South Africa 's white apartheid rulers and the black majority . \\nMany also doubt Northern Ireland 's decades of violence could have been brought hopefully to a close if Britain had still been looking to prosecute sometime IRA militants . \\nA week into Libya 's uprising , the country is effectively divided between Gaddafi loyalist and opposition forces in what some fear could be the opening stages of a civil war . \\nForeign governments say hundreds if not thousands have been killed already , while aid agencies fear a humanitarian crisis . \\nOutside powers demand that Gaddafi stand down , threatening no-fly zones , sanctions and possibly further military action -- although critics say that can also back intransigent rulers into a corner . \\nBut the foreign powers say the risk of war crimes charges should deter followers from attacking civilians and might help prompt his ouster . \\n`` International prosecutions can sometimes carry risks , such as causing brutal dictators to entrench rather than step down and face justice , '' said Matthew Waxman , professor at Columbia Law School and fellow at the U.S. Council on Foreign Relations . \\n`` However , -LRB- they -RRB- can also help isolate perpetrators ... hastening their demise while also laying the foundation for longer term stability and serving broader interests in justice and deterrence . '' \\nIt is possible any war crimes prosecution could still be halted in its tracks if foreign powers chose to do so . \\nInterviewed by Reuters in 2005 shortly before the ICC issued an arrest warrant for the head of Uganda 's LRA leader Joseph Kony , prosecutor Moreno-Ocampo said he might in general agree to halting proceedings in a country if that would bring peace . \\nSome in Uganda and elsewhere had warned that issuing warrants against the LRA for child abduction and killing might make it impossible to reach an agreement with them . \\nKony ultimately refused to sign a peace deal after talks hosted by South Sudan , some say because he feared ICC prosecution . \\nHe and his fighters fled into nearby Congo and are still at large , continuing to raid villages there and in Sudan . \\nBut Human Rights Watch 's head of the international justice program , Richard Dicker , said it was now barely even legally possible to simply cancel proceedings . \\n`` The world has changed with the passing of the Rome Statute , '' he said , referring to the 2002 treaty establishing the ICC . \\n`` There 's just not the legal option to offer ... to stop the legal process . \\nThe option of letting Gaddafi walk away without any legal consequences just is n't on the table any more . '' \\nIn reality , international justice remains likely to be highly selective . \\nAny one of the permanent five UN Security Council members of the U.S. , Britain , France , Russia or China can effectively block a probe . \\nThat means Chinese actions in Tibet and elsewhere , Russian clampdowns in Chechnya or alleged Western abuses in Iraq , Afghanistan and Guantanamo Bay are all off the agenda . \\nClose friends of Security Council powers such as U.S. ally Israel or China 's friends Myanmar or Sri Lanka also tend to enjoy more diplomatic cover . \\n`` It 's a far from perfect system ... an uneven playing field , '' said Human Rights Watch 's Dicker . \\n`` But I believe ... we are moving in the right direction . \\nIf you look at eastern Congo , you have warlords who have been given amnesty time and time again ... in a short-term search for peace . \\nThey have returned to commit even more vicious atrocities . \\nYou have to have systems that will bring justice .

Duff wrote in an August 2008 e-mail that `` hundreds if not thousands '' of engineering documents were incomplete , and suggested these insufficient safety records `` could lead to catastrophic operator errors .

2010 7:56 am EDT WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The U.S. Congress is turning its focus this week to the federal government 's response to the Gulf of Mexico oil spill , but the offshore oil drilling industry is far from off the hook . \\nCongressional pressure on federal agencies , especially the Interior Department 's Minerals Management Service , is likely to lead to tighter rules for the oil and natural gas sector . \\nThe Senate Homeland Security committee kicked off a series of hearings examining the government 's role in the cleanup of the massive oil leak threatening the U.S. Gulf Coast on Monday with testimony from Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano . \\nInterior Secretary Ken Salazar and Environmental Protection Agency chief Lisa Jackson are scheduled to answer lawmakers ' questions regarding the rig disaster on Tuesday . \\nExecutives from BP Plc and Transocean Ltd will also face more congressional grilling this week . \\nBP is already facing legislation that would make the company pay more for the economic damages resulting from the rig accident . \\nMeanwhile , the White House last week offered its own legislative plan to pay for the spill . \\nFollowing is a look at some of the new laws and regulations that may result from the spill . \\nFacing attacks for not doing enough to prevent the rig disaster , the Interior Department last week announced it would change the way it oversees offshore drilling . \\nIn addition to separating the Minerals Management Service 's oil royalty collection and safety inspection roles , the department is reviewing environmental permitting procedures for offshore oil production . \\nAs part of the shift , the Obama administration has asked for an additional $ 29 million to pay for more inspections of offshore platforms and a review of procedures . \\nThe overhaul is expected to lead to stricter regulations of offshore drilling . \\nWith the agency coming under heavy fire for allowing BP to bypass some environmental studies , there will likely be more stringent environmental analysis and oil spill response plans . \\nRegulators will also likely establish more rules regarding the equipment and techniques used in offshore oil production . \\nThe current focus on faulty blowout preventers and well cementing procedures as a possible causes for the accident will likely lead to more standards in those areas . \\nInterior has placed a moratorium on any new offshore drilling permits until at least May 28 when a safety review is due to be completed . \\nAny significant extension of this moratorium could have a major impact on offshore drilling companies and lower projected Gulf oil production . \\nSenate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs chairman Joseph Lieberman said on Monday that until questions surrounding the preparation and response efforts for this deepwater oil spill are answered , the government should not allow any new deepwater wells to be permitted and drilled . \\nSome lawmakers from coastal states have also called for a complete halt to offshore drilling in any new areas , saying the risk is just too great for coastal economies . \\nStill other lawmakers are still looking to expand offshore drilling , but with additional protections in place . \\nThe Senate climate bill released last week would allow U.S. states to prohibit offshore oil activity within 75 miles of their coasts . \\nLawmakers in both chambers have proposed bills that would raise the amount of money BP would be required to dole out for economic losses caused by the spill to $ 10 billion from the current cap of $ 75 million . \\nU.S. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid on Monday said a $ 10 billion liability limit would be `` inadequate , '' however . \\nWhile it is unclear exactly how much the cap will be lifted , it is almost certain that BP and other oil companies drilling offshore will be responsible for covering much more than $ 75 million in economic losses in the future . \\nThere are also likely to be changes to the federal Oil Spill Liability Trust Fund , authorized for use in the aftermath of the Exxon Valdez disaster . \\nLawmakers are considering raising the 8 cent per barrel fee the industry pays to support the fund by 1 to 25 cents . \\nThe White House proposal released last week would increase this per barrel fee by 1 cent . \\nDemocratic Senator Frank Lautenberg of New Jersey has introduced legislation that would impose an annual fee of $ 10 for every acre leased for offshore drilling to raise money for clean energy transportation technology . \\nLautenberg said the fee could raise $ 1.8 billion a year . \\nThe additional fees and liability risks could hurt smaller oil and natural gas operators offshore that may not be able to handle the costs . \\nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \\nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of

'' \\nOysters are conspicuous in their absence from the statement , which you can read at Galatoires.com . \\nAs Brett Anderson reported in the Times-Picayune on June 13 , the dwindling supply of local oysters in the wake of the oil spill forced Galatoire 's executive chef Brian Landry to scour the restaurant 's decades of menus , looking for traditional dishes to replace those featuring the local bivalves . \\nChicken livers en brochette , however , just do n't appeal to me as much as oysters prepared the same way . \\nAs food writers , we were already lamenting this latest devastating blow to the vibrant cuisine . \\nAt the end of the conference and before the speakers ' dinner , I slipped away in a merciful rain shower with culinary scholar Jessica Harris and Latin chefs Maricel Presilla and Patricia Wilson -LRB- all three PhDs -RRB- to Dickie Brennan 's nearby Bourbon House , renowned for the quality of its oysters . \\nWe were reassured that the oysters were all from Area 9 in Plaquemines , west of the Mississippi River . \\nIt 's one of two areas that have been reopened temporarily as the Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals tests gulf oysters and oyster waters . \\nIt was Saturday afternoon , about 5 o'clock . \\nBourbon House sits squarely on the corner of Iberville and boisterous Bourbon Street , in the heart of the French Quarter . \\nThe Beans + Rice conference -LRB- where we had lectured -RRB- , the Creole Tomato Festival and the Louisiana Seafood Festival were going on simultaneously in the Quarter , so there were even more foodies than normal in New Orleans , if that 's imaginable . \\nBut Bourbon House was n't half-full -- at happy hour on Saturday -- and several lesser-known oyster bars we passed were empty . \\nI 'm the first to admit that I prefer the brinier East Coast oysters of the R months , if for no other reason than that 's what I grew up with . \\nBut , as Presilla noted , the plump , meaty oysters from Plaquemines that we ate on Saturday `` beg to be cooked and sauced . '' \\nWe ordered several dozen , both cooked and raw , tossing them back with champagne . \\n-LRB- The best I had were the wood-fired ones at Cochon . -RRB- \\nWistfully , we snapped cellphone photos of what might well be among the last Gulf Coast oysters for a while . \\nWe walked back to the hotel in the rain . \\nI do n't get to the Gulf Coast often , but no food writer can ignore the bountiful cornucopia of the New Orleans table . \\nThere 's noplace else in the world quite like the Crescent City , with its Creole and Cajun cultures , its sultry weather , its magnificent architecture , its self-proclaimed decadence . \\nMardi Gras , Jazz Fest and Friday at Galatoire 's are no more excessive than an ordinary meal in New Orleans . \\nMounds of beans and rice , sweetbreads , vegetables swimming in hollandaise and oysters Rockefeller are mere side dishes or appetizers . \\nCourses that follow are stuffed with crabmeat , garnished with crawfish and invariably sauced , followed by gumbo , jambalaya or fried soft-shell crabs with sauce Choron . \\nFor as long as I can remember , I have eaten oysters , frog 's legs , shrimp , crawfish and drum . \\nThat 's because I was born a stone 's throw from the Mississippi , in Baton Rouge . \\nWhen I was 3 , we moved to the very similar terrain of the South Carolina low country . \\nI have lived through several hurricanes , including Hugo , which put me out of house and business for a year . \\nWhen I was growing up , my mother would send me out in our sailboat 's dinghy to catch lunch . \\nIn autumn , I would cast our old circular shrimp net into the brackish waters of the salt marsh , pulling in several pounds of shrimp . \\nAt low tide in winter , I would gather oysters and clams from the then-pristine waters , my mother tossing back into the creek any oysters under 10 inches long . \\nIn spring , the crab trap offered up not only those luscious blue crabs , but flounder and eel as well . \\nMy older sister Nancy returned to Louisiana to attend LSU . \\nOn the rare occasion that she was home , she gloated about her meals at Galatoire 's : turtle soup , shrimp remoulade , crabmeat omelet , crawfish etouffee and , of course , those oysters . \\nShortly after Nancy went away to school , we began spending a lot of time on our sailboat down on the estuaries behind Hilton Head Island . \\nFor years ours was one of a handful of pleasure craft docked or moored there . \\nWe envied her restaurant meals in Louisiana , but we had a wealth of seafood a cast or trap away . \\nThese days , I drive a car , use air conditioning and leave all sorts of appliances and electronic equipment plugged in , their digital clocks constantly draining electricity and increasing our demand for cheap fuel . \\nNo matter what I think about BP , I know that I , too , am partly to blame for the oil spill , because I add to that demand . \\nWe are all incensed about the ecological damage to the gulf , but multinational oil companies have spilled many millions of gallons in the Niger Delta over the years , polluting the air , water and soil of millions of Nigerians who depend on fish from the rivers simply to sustain their lives . \\nI can give you a ballpark estimate of how many turtles and dolphins have washed up dead in the oily mess in the gulf , but I can not tell you the name of a single one of the people who lost their lives in the rig fire . \\nI am embarrassed by my own myopia and greed . \\nI am livid about the gulf oil spill , and I worry about the seafood industry , but I also know that many of the thousands of jobs affected by the spill are for manual laborers who will never set foot in the temples of Creole cuisine about which I , with my bourgeois tastes and wallet , tend to wax poetic . \\nI am angry and worried about the people of Louisiana . \\nHow much more can they take ? \\nDo I continue to order oysters out of season in hopes of contributing to the demand for them , so that prices will go higher and help the Gulf Coast seafood industry if and when it is able to return to business ? \\nDo I continue to write purplish prose about my favorite seafood dishes while fishermen are out of work ? \\nThis tragedy should present us all with moral dilemmas . \\nI think we must demand change , but change begins at home . \\nAs President Obama noted in his June 15 speech about the disaster , `` we ca n't afford not to change how we produce and use energy . '' \\nBoycotting BP will only hurt your local gas station owner . \\nInstead , slow down , use public transportation , and carpool . \\nSet your air conditioning a few degrees higher . \\nTurn off your computer and cellphone when they 're not in use . \\nAnd this weekend , forgo those bottles of champagne and imported wine and instead write a check to one of the nonprofit groups that are prepared to employ trained volunteers to help clean up the mess and restore the fisheries .

Hollabaugh noted that `` we 're in the beginning stages of the litigation , '' and that it could take as long as a year to complete . \\nOne veteran complex litigation attorney estimated that unless there is a quick settlement that satisfies all sides , it will be 2015 before any trials begin and at least 2028 before appeals and other legal issues are fully resolved . \\nThe attorney , Lela Hollabaugh of Nashville , Tenn. , pointed out that it took 20 years to complete all claims from the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil disaster in Alaska . \\n`` When you 're looking at an incident like this , which has so many different parties in different states , you just simply ca n't get through the litigation quickly , '' Hollabaugh said . \\n`` It just takes a long time to move through the process . '' \\nSo far , at least 300 federal lawsuits have been filed in 12 states against BP and the other three main companies involved in the April 20 explosion aboard the Deepwater Horizon drill rig , which triggered the nation 's worst-ever offshore oil spill . \\nVirtually every lawsuit names as defendants BP , rig owner Transocean Ltd. , well contractor Halliburton Co. and Cameron International , maker of the well 's failed blowout preventer . \\nThe plaintiffs make up the entire mosaic of the Gulf Coast : shrimpers and oystermen , charter boat captains , beach resort and condo owners , restaurants and bars , seafood suppliers , bait and tackle shops , even tourist attractions like Key West 's Ripley 's Believe It or Not museum . \\nMost of the parties claim severe economic losses from the oil spill , ranging from the fish they can no longer catch to tourists who never arrived to rent rooms . \\nThere are also a few wrongful death and injury lawsuits filed , mainly in state courts , by workers who survived the Deepwater Horizon explosion and relatives of some of the 11 men who died . \\nAnd some BP investors also have sued , claiming the company 's mistakes led to a sharp drop in its stock price . \\nA federal judicial panel is meeting Thursday in Boise , Idaho , to consider whether to consolidate some or all of the lawsuits for pretrial decisions before a single judge , a development that most observers say is a foregone conclusion . \\nBP and the other companies favor federal court in Houston -- near their major U.S. operations -- while a majority of plaintiffs ' attorneys have suggested New Orleans , closer to the broken well and to many of the hardest-hit victims . \\nCourts in Florida , Mississippi and Alabama also are being suggested as venues . \\nIt 's difficult to estimate potential damages that BP could be forced to pay , or what shape a settlement might take . \\nBut legal experts say BP alone is looking at some $ 2 billion in costs just to defend itself , with the $ 20 billion fund set aside to pay oil spill claims and cleanup costs potentially not enough to foot the entire bill . \\n`` There 's no way it 's going to be enough , '' said Victor Diaz , a Miami attorney experienced in similar large-scale cases such as those involving faulty Chinese drywall . \\n`` We still do n't know what will happen later , what the second and third wave of damages might be . \\nWhat happens if six months later , some fish species is wiped out ? '' \\nOne example of post-spill lawsuits : the owners of a Louisiana shrimp boat claim in a new lawsuit they are suffering health problems including headaches , nausea and shortness of breath after working for BP in the collecting and burning of oil in the Gulf . \\nBP 's liability is already larger than the Exxon Valdez case , which ultimately led to a $ 500 million payout to affected fishermen and residents . \\nOther large `` mass tort '' cases include drug maker Merck & Co. 's agreement in 2008 to a $ 4.85 billion settlement of some 50,000 cases stemming from its withdrawn painkiller Vioxx . \\nAlso , Pharmaceutical company Wyeth initially settled claims over its diet drug fen-phen for $ 3.75 billion in 1999 , but that soared to more than $ 21 billion by 2004 as more claims were filed . \\nAsbestos , which has caused widespread lung disease and other ailments , is the longest-running mass lawsuit case in U.S. history , costing a variety of companies more than $ 70 billion and involving more than 730,000 claims since the 1970s , according to an analysis by the nonprofit Rand Corp. . \\nAnd tobacco companies have been slapped with thousands of lawsuits over the dangers of cigarette smoking . \\nThey won most of them until the major companies agreed in 1998 to a 25-year , $ 206 billion settlement with 46 states who sued over the costs to their health programs . \\nThe BP case will differ in many ways from those involving drug companies , automakers and asbestos manufacturers , where people died or suffered illnesses directly caused by the product . \\nIn an oil spill , oystermen whose beds were choked off by oil might have relatively easy claims to prove , but what about a beachfront hotelier whose business fell off , or a property owner whose house may suddenly be worth much less ? \\n`` People who have those indirect claims are going to have a difficult time under any situation , '' Hollabaugh said . \\n`` Where does it end ? \\nYou could say the oil spill has harmed our whole country . '' \\nMany of the lawsuits are proposed class actions , in which a plaintiff such as a commercial fisherman or a property owner seeks to represent everyone else in the same situation . \\nOne task for the judge appointed to preside over the consolidated cases is sorting out which of those overlap , and which should be deemed class actions . \\nOne wild card is the claims process created by BP and President Barack Obama 's administration . \\nThat process , administered by attorney Kenneth Feinberg , promises oil spill victims quicker access to money for what BP calls `` legitimate '' claims than the traditional legal process . \\nFeinberg is touting the plan as a generous alternative to a lawsuit , telling one audience in Washington that although legal action remains an option , `` You 're crazy to do so . '' \\nFeinberg made similar arguments in convincing most survivors and victims ' families to join the federal 9\\/11 compensation fund rather than sue airlines or other companies individually over the terror attacks . \\nSome plaintiffs ' attorneys have raised questions about how the claims process can guarantee a fair result . \\nBut Howard Erichson , a law professor at Fordham University , said people also are taking their chances with the court system . \\n`` Litigation is expensive , it 's time-consuming , it is unpredictable , '' Erichson said . \\n`` The results often vary in unpredictable ways . \\nPlaintiffs in mass tort litigation end up losing a lot of the money to legal fees and expenses . \\nIf the compensation fund is fair , I 'm all for it . '' \\nAnother unknown is whether BP and the other Deepwater Horizon companies will work together to defend themselves or sue each other . \\nMuch depends on the outcome of a Justice Department criminal investigation that could point the finger more heavily at one or the other ; Transocean is already asking a federal judge in Houston to limit its liability to $ 27 million under a century-old law meant to cut losses for shipping companies when vessels like the floating Deepwater Horizon rig are sunk . \\nSomewhat forgotten in all the economic litigation are the rig victims and their families . \\nMichelle Jones , the wife of lost rig worker Gordon Jones , wants to keep her lawsuit separate so it does not get lost in the shuffle . \\n`` While the damages incurred by the fishermen and property owners is significant , the stakes in Jones ' case involves everyday living expenses and the education costs for her two children , '' Michelle Jones ' attorney wrote in a federal court filing . \\n`` After losing her husband , and her sons losing their father , she may have to wait years .

The cabinet played no part once it had resolved to defend the neutrality of Belgium ... Nor did the cabinet authorise the declaration of war . \\n \\n‚Ñ¢ The question is , do you take that one step further and get rid of the medieval royal prerogative . \\nNor was this the end of the prerogative powers . \\nThe governments and parliaments of Britain 's dominions were not consulted either . \\nEach governor general proclaimed the war on his own authority - except in Canada , whose parliament , alone in the empire , voted its approval . \\nOver 300 million African and Asian people across the globe were thus involved , without any consultation , `` in a war of which they understood nothing against an enemy who was also unknown to them '' , as Taylor puts it . \\nThe past is another country . \\nThey do things differently there . \\nExcept , actually , they do n't . \\nToday it may be impossible to imagine many things about the first world war occurring in anything like the same manner . \\nThe suffering of the western front would not have lasted for a week in the age of the mobile phone or the human-rights lawyer , for example . \\nBut the prerogative power to take the nation to war , central to the process of August 1914 , is still there almost unamended , as though nothing has changed since the late middle ages . \\nThere is , of course , something of an exaggeration in this description . \\nThe royal prerogative powers , already formal in 1914 , are even more formal today . \\nDemocratic politics , at least as much as human-rights law , has transformed the political context not just of a decision to go to war but of all the residual prerogative powers . \\nIn practice the government exercises these powers on the crown 's behalf . \\nAnd in practice it will only do so if parliament does not object . \\nNevertheless almost none of this is written down . \\nIn principle , if not in practice , a prime minister could take the nation to war in defiance of a parliamentary vote ; he wields a theoretical power that a believer in the divine right of kings would have recognized . \\nThroughout the 20th century these powers remained mostly uncontroversial and unchallenged . \\nYet they persisted as the basis for war-making . \\nIn September 1939 the declaration was reported by Neville Chamberlain to parliament as an accomplished fact . \\nMPs did get the chance to vote on substantive motions on the Korean war in 1950 and the Gulf war in 1991 , but only after troops had been deployed and hostilities had begun . \\nThe Iraq war in 2003 broke new constitutional ground in many ways , in particular because a British government for the first time allowed MPs a substantive vote on a war before it began . \\nThis was in one sense a tactical response to governmental weakness , an implicit recognition that domestic politics required Tony Blair to obtain the authority of parliament for an exceptionally divisive conflict . \\nBut it was also a response to a growing sense among constitutional reformers that the government 's exercise of this most powerful of prerogatives was now under greater question . \\nThree months before the war , Blair debated this issue with the Commons liaison committee . \\nHe agreed with the MPs that it would be right for parliament , and good for government , for there to be a vote . \\n`` There is a right to vote , '' he even told the committee , before entering a caveat . \\n`` The question is , do you take that one step further and get rid of the royal prerogative . \\nI do not see any reason to change it , but I do really think that in the end it is more theoretical than real , this issue . '' \\nIn practice , Blair said , `` I can not think of any circumstances in which a government can go to war without the support of parliament . '' \\nArguably this was always the case . \\nYet it is important to recognize that the nature of modern warfare has significantly increased the realism of Blair 's statement . \\nIt is difficult to foresee the kind of total existential threat to the nation that British governments believed they faced in 1805 , 1914 or 1939 . \\nThe wars that Britain is likely to fight in the 21st century are likely to be fought exclusively by professional forces , as part of an alliance , in the name of the international order rather than exclusively national interest , with real-time media coverage on both sides of the frontline , and in circumstances that cause minimal or no disruption at all to everyday life at home . \\nThe longevity and adaptability of this country 's old war-making rules have been truly extraordinary . \\nBut modern wars fought in modern democratic societies are increasingly posing new questions and demanding new rules , as the historic parliamentary vote in March 2003 over Iraq implied . \\nThis is not to advocate change for change 's sake but to recognize that war-making in modern , rights-based societies requires new forms of legitimacy . \\nWhich is one of several reasons why Clare Short 's private member 's bill requiring parliamentary approval for military action is both so interesting and so important . \\nShort 's bill requires governments to do what the Blair government did voluntarily in 2003 . \\nBut by explicitly removing war-making from prerogative powers and vesting that power in parliament , the bill goes significantly further . \\nThe bill requires a government to set out a written political and legal justification of armed action . \\nIf parliament does not approve , troops must not be committed . \\nWhile allowing governments to embark on armed conflict in emergencies , the bill also gives MPs retrospective powers over emergency deployments . \\nShort 's sponsorship will inspire some and provoke others . \\nBut it would be petty to see the bill as an excuse to rerun old arguments about Iraq . \\nFor this is , in the best sense , a modernizing measure . \\nIt seeks to bring both the law of war and the system of public accountability for war-making abreast of modern realities . \\nIt puts parliament in charge of the most important decision that any nation can ever take . \\nFlaws the bill may have , but they can be ironed out in committee . \\nThe bill 's second-reading vote in October will be a defining moment for all MPs who claim to be modernisers . \\nAlready many big names in all parties have given their support . \\nNot the least of those MPs was the late Robin Cook . \\nIf all those tributes to Cook mean anything at all then the vote on October 21 will be a chance to turn those words into something lasting and practical in his memory .

'' \\nUS President Barack Obama had earlier called the incident the worst oil spillage disaster in US history . \\nHe also said his administration would prosecute over the oil spill if laws have been broken , and promised to change the law if necessary to prevent another such disaster . \\nThe nearly $ 1bn clean-up cost to date includes $ 40m in economic injury claims , as well as grants to the authorities in the US states located in the Gulf area . \\nHowever , the latest fall in BP 's shares suggests that markets now expect the ultimate cost to the company from the oil spill to be much more severe than this . \\nBP 's share price closed on Friday at # 4.95 , but fell to # 4.12 after the markets reopened on Tuesday - after a Monday bank holiday - before closing at # 4.30 . \\nBP 's legal liability in the US is currently limited by law to a mere $ 75m , although this is expected to be increased to $ 10bn . \\nOil booms - partly successful Dispersant used - scientists warn it may kill marine life Huge dome placed over leak - became blocked by ice crystals Mile-long tube - fails to suck up large amount of oil `` Top-kill '' method to pump heavy mud - abandoned `` The markets are pricing in an apocalyptic scenario , '' said Evgeny Solovyov , equity analyst at SG Securities in London . \\nHe added that BP owns only 65 % of the oil well , meaning its legal liability will be limited to just $ 6.5 bn - although it could go higher if BP were found guilty of gross negligence or a criminal act . \\n`` The markets seem to assume that BP will have to withdraw from America , '' he added , noting that there was talk among government lawyers about barring the oil company from US government contracts . \\nBP is also the biggest participant in deep sea drilling in the Gulf of Mexico , and therefore is likely to be hardest hit by the moratorium on this activity announced by President Barack Obama . \\nThe sharp fall in BP 's share price is bad news for UK pension funds , which are major shareholders in the firm . \\nThe oil company has claimed that it pays # 1 in every # 7 of dividends that the pension funds receive from FTSE 100 companies . \\nAlthough the price change does not directly affect BP 's ability to pay dividends , it does indicate that markets are anticipating a significant cut . \\nSome oil analysts have also speculated that if BP 's share price continues to fall , the company may find that it becomes an affordable takeover target for some of its global rivals . \\nBP now hopes to cap the leak by using undersea robots to slice through the damaged pipe to make a clean cut that can be connected to another pipe , capturing the leaking oil . \\nHowever , this strategy may not stop the oil spill completely . \\nThat will only happen once BP has finished drilling two new relief wells - something that is not expected to be ready before August . \\nThe White House said the president had been informed that the flow rate could increase by as much as 20 % until the containment device was applied over the leak . \\nUniversity of Alabama engineering professor Philip W Johnson told Associated Press news agency that although he was hopeful the plan would succeed , if the new cap could not be placed on the fresh cut , `` things will get much worse '' . \\nThe system is similar to a previous containment dome plan that failed . \\nMeanwhile , the oil giant said it was stepping up its containment strategy . \\nIt said that the total length of the boom - used to collect oil floating on the sea surface - would be almost doubled to 3.7 million ft. . \\nBP also now plans to use hoses and other equipment deployed in the failed `` top kill '' strategy to siphon off more of the leaking oil . \\n`` BP 's priority is to keep as much oil as we can from causing additional harm to the Gulf , the shoreline and the people of the region , '' said BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward on Monday . \\n`` This planned multi-step containment strategy is our best option for achieving this as we work hard towards completing the relief wells that will kill this well completely .

'' \\nRussia has close ties with Assad 's government , which has been a client for arms sales , and has a naval maintenance facility on Syria 's Mediterranean coast . \\nBeijing and Moscow , which had voiced concern that the draft could pave the way for Libya-style military intervention , also want to limit Western influence in the Middle East , while the United States and Europe have long sought to loosen Syria 's alliance with Iran . \\nAssad has used tanks and troops to crush an uprising which erupted in March , inspired by regional revolts which toppled three North African leaders this year . \\nThe United Nations says 2,700 civilians have been killed . \\nDamascus blames the violence on foreign-backed armed groups which it says have killed at least 700 security personnel . \\nSyria 's economy is reeling from the impact of the unrest and U.S. and European sanctions on the small but key oil sector . \\nAssad faces a more united opposition after groups in exile came together in Istanbul on Sunday to call for his downfall , but the U.N. vote marks a setback to his opponents who had hoped for an escalation in international pressure on Damascus . \\n`` We deeply regret the positions of Russia and China toward the resolution , '' said Omar Idlibi of the grassroots Local Coordination Committee in Beirut , adding he had `` not lost hope in the international community .

Ewen MacAskill emphasized : `` Saddam 's personal doctor '' was an artist but also one of Saddam 's personal doctors . \\nThe question then is whether there is enough to justify 400 pages . \\nThe answer is maybe , mainly because of what has happened . \\nNoting the first anniversary of the fall of Baghdad , he writes : `` A year had gone by , but it seemed as if Baghdad had not really fallen at all - or perhaps it was still falling . '' \\nAnderson , rightly , identifies the US killing of 17 demonstrators in Fallujah about two weeks after the famous fall of the Saddam statue as a `` historic watershed '' . \\nThe Iraqis took their revenge , and by the end of the spring `` it was becoming clear that the Americans were faced with an intensifying guerrilla insurgency in Iraq '' . \\nA problem with too many books written by journalists about war is that they tend to be mainly about the journalists and less about the population that is suffering . \\nAnderson does write probably too much about his colleagues but he also writes movingly about the general population and the suffering . \\nOn a visit to a hospital , an Iraqi doctor introduces him to 12-year-old Ali , a victim of the war . \\nHis torso is blackened and both his arms burned off . \\nHis stumps `` looked like something that might be found in a barbecue pit '' . \\nDid he like sports ? \\nYes , volleyball and soccer . \\nHis mother and father and one of his brothers had been killed , but he had not yet been told . \\nOn the whole , though , there is not enough in the book about the Iraqis , especially the poorest , in part because western journalists ' contact with the Iraqi population was often so difficult . \\nThere was a brief window of a few months immediately after the war when it was possible for western journalists to travel anywhere and talk openly to almost anyone but Anderson , understandably given he had just covered the war in Iraq , had gone home for most of this period . \\nA definitive account of the innermost life of Iraqis before , during and since the war has still to be written , and maybe it will require an Iraqi rather than a western journalist to write it . \\nClare Short 's book is not directly about the Iraqis . \\nIt deals with the still contentious way in which Tony Blair and his government , of which she was a part , took Britain to war alongside the US . \\nSome politicians can make money from their books by selling publication rights to newspa pers , an expensive but easy source of `` exclusives '' . \\nOne of the problems with Short 's combined biography and rant against Blair 's administration is that there is little that is exclusive . \\nWe already know she feels duped by Blair over the war - the `` honorable deception '' - and the extent of feuding between Blair and Gordon Brown , and the British bugging of Kofi Annan . \\nThis lack of news interest is a back-handed compliment . \\nShe was always too honest and open , whether in the Commons or in front of a newspaper reporter or a BBC microphone . \\nShe did not hold back to ensure largesse when the rights to her book went out to auction . \\nHer diary entries , though sparse , form the best part of the book . \\nThere is an immediacy about them , the views not influenced by hindsight , particularly her references to Brown , whom she would like to see replace Blair . \\nHer critique is that the US and Britain rushed to war in Iraq with unseemly haste and for the wrong reasons . \\nShe recalls various conversations with Blair and concludes that he seemed to have been manipulating her , making promises to keep her on side and to delay her resignation , a postponement that damaged her credibility . \\nShe , too , may have been at fault , hearing what she wanted to hear , not wanting to lose her beloved department . \\nBut her verdict on him is uncompromising : `` The question is , does Tony Blair even realize that he so often gives promises and breaks his word and has so little respect for the truth ? '' \\nHer public opposition to the war angered colleagues , who accused her of being sanctimonious and undisciplined . \\nBut she was saying in public and to Blair what many of them thought privately but were not prepared to say , either publicly or to Blair . \\nby Clare Short This article appeared on p12 of the Guardian review section of the Guardian on 01.35 GMT on Saturday 12 February 2005 Latest news and views from the Guardian 's books team paullaity : Read this : clever and funny and rightly cutting .

'' \\nObama 's Democrats , who control both houses of Congress , are expected to lose seats in the election and want to avoid shifting power to Republicans , who would make it more difficult for the president to achieve his policy goals . \\nObama is aware of the government angle in the crisis and has made his displeasure with the Minerals Management Service -LRB- MMS -RRB- , the Interior Department agency that regulates offshore drilling , very clear . \\nThat agency is now being restructured , but other policy consequences loom , most notably the president 's efforts to pass energy legislation that would reduce greenhouse gas emissions , increase domestic production of renewable fuels and -- tricky under current circumstances -- expand offshore drilling . \\nJohn Leshy , who served as general counsel for the Interior Department in the Clinton administration , said the spill could hurt Obama 's short-term prospects for an energy overhaul . \\n`` Clearly the spill has dramatized the cost of fossil fuels -- coal , oil and gas , particularly oil . \\nSo to that extent it has , I think , boosted the idea that there needs to be energy reform , '' said Leshy , now a professor at the University of California Hastings College of the Law . \\n`` But in the short term you have to get 60 votes in the Senate , '' he said . \\n`` I think the spill has made that harder .

warned he faces grilling cents Obama compares impact of oil spill with 9\\/11 Barack Obama speaks at a briefing on the BP oil spill in Gulfport , Mississippi . \\nPhotograph : Jim Young\\/Reuters BP is being accused by a US congressional committee of ignoring warnings , violating its own industry guidelines , and choosing risky procedures in the hope of cutting costs and saving time in the days leading up to the catastrophic explosion of the Deepwater Horizon oil rig . \\nTony Hayward , BP 's chief executive , was served notice on Monday by the committee on energy and commerce that it intends to subject him to the most rigorous inquisition the company has yet faced in the 56-day-old crisis . \\nA letter from the committee 's chairman , Henry Waxman , said `` time after time , it appears BP made decisions that increased the risk of a blowout to save the company time or expense '' . \\nHayward 's hearing will take place on Thursday , towards the end of a crucial week in which the tensions between US politicians and BP are likely to escalate . \\nBarack Obama will tonight make his first address to the American people from the Oval Office , underlining the scale of the catastrophe now unfolding in the Gulf of Mexico and vowing to hold BP to account for the environmental damage wrought by its eight-week-old oil spill . \\nObama is expected to use the speech to outline plans to force the firm to set up an independently monitored multibillion-dollar fund to compensate victims of the spill . \\nHe will also lay out a detailed timeline of how the worst of the calamity could be contained . \\nHours before the broadcast , the energy and environment sub-committee of the House of Representatives will call senior BP officials in front of it to answer questions on the company 's handling of the crisis . \\nThen tomorrow , Obama will hold his first meeting with a team of top BP staff led by the chairman , Carl-Henric Svanberg , and expected to include Hayward who has so far avoided a face-to-face encounter with the president . \\nBut it will be the forensic questioning of Hayward in front of Thursday 's committee on energy and commerce upon which BP 's fate now potentially hangs . \\nWaxman 's advance letter runs to 14 pages and contains damaging allegations gathered during previous hearings . \\nFive days before the 20 April explosion , the letter contends , BP was warned by its own drilling engineer that this was a `` nightmare well '' . \\nYet the firm went on to make five crucial decisions that the committee alleges put profit before safety . \\nBP , at this point , was up against the clock , attempting to complete drilling so that the Deepwater Horizon rig could be moved to another location , avoiding overrun costs . \\nThe five accusations levelled at BP by the committee are : cents That it adopted a cheap design for the well , choosing a single casing rather than a more sophisticated design , despite the fact that its own analysis found strongly in favor of the latter . \\n`` The decision appears to have been made to save time and reduce costs , '' the letter says . \\ncents BP went with the cheapest option of using just six `` centralisers '' , which hold the casing in the center of the borehole , despite being advised by its contractors Halliburton to use 21 . \\nHalliburton warned that the well had a `` SEVERE gas flow problem '' and that using six centralisers would risk the success of the procedure . \\ncents BP decided not to carry out an acoustic test designed to measure the efficacy of the cementing of the well to block off gas flows . \\nThe test would have cost $ 128,000 and taken an extra 12 hours . \\nAn independent engineer who gave evidence to the committee said it was `` unheard of '' not to perform the test and slammed the decision as being `` horribly negligent '' . \\ncents BP failed to check the proper workings of the new well system by circulating drilling mud from its bottom to the surface . \\nHalliburton suggested the lack of a full test was due to BP 's desire for speed . \\ncents The firm did not install a critical piece of equipment that locks the wellhead and the casing at the level of the sea floor . \\nThe absence of the `` lockdown sleeve '' has been identified as one possible cause of the explosion . \\nWaxman 's letter concludes that BP must answer to the committee for possible `` carelessness and complacency '' that `` inflicted a heavy toll on the Gulf , its inhabitants and the workers on the rig . \\nThe new offensive by Congress came as Obama began a two-day visit to the stricken region . \\nAfter he had landed in Gulfport , Mississippi , he likened the environmental impact of the Deep Horizon explosion to the impact on the national psyche of 9\\/11 . \\nIn an interview with the website Politico , he said : `` In the same way that our view of our vulnerabilities and our foreign policy was shaped profoundly by 9\\/11 , I think this disaster is going to shape how we think about the environment and energy for many years to come . '' \\nThe comparison drew some angry responses from families of the victims of the 9\\/11 attacks . \\nBP has now passed a 72-hour ultimatum set for it by the Obama administration to come up with a more focused plan for how to bring the spill under control . \\nWorst-case scenarios , estimated by US government scientists , suggest that up to 40,000 barrels of oil could be spewing out into the Gulf each day , with only 15,000 barrels currently being collected by a cap placed over the wrecked well . \\nThe company has outlined a series of methods it intends to implement that it claims will see the amount of captured oil rise to up to 80,000 barrels a day by mid-July . \\nThe Democrat congressman is famous for in 1994 forcing chiefs of tobacco giants to swear under oath that nicotine was not addictive . \\nHe will seek the same killer punch against Tony Hayward on Thursday , when BP 's CEO appears before a panel of the House energy and commerce committee . \\nExpect him to press Hayward hard on whether BP put profit before safety . \\nWith a long track record of holding power to account from the nuclear electricity industry to the US government over torture Markey has become a leading critic of BP 's handling of the Deepwater Horizon crisis . \\n`` They are either incompetent or they are lying , '' he has said of BP chiefs . \\nToday the Democratic congressman will call BP America 's president , Lamar McKay , as well as the bosses of rival oil companies in front of his House energy and environment sub-committee . \\nLikely line of questioning : why BP 's estimates of the size of the spill have been so massively wide of the mark . \\nBarack Obama 's press spokesman , who has been `` kicking ass '' on the president 's behalf , has been accused of whipping up anti-British feeling by referring to British Petroleum rather than BP , the firm 's rebranded name . \\nHe has also used such fruity language as : `` We will keep our boot on the throat of BP '' . \\nGibbs says the administration is just focused on what 's right . \\nThe US coastguard admiral who Obama put in charge of the clean-up operation last week issued BP with a 72-hour ultimatum to come up with solid plans on how to contain the leak . \\nAllen has been careful in his criticisms of BP until now , saying it has generally been co-operative . \\nBut daily media exposure of Allen , in which he has come across as energetic and action-oriented , has only served to make BP look all the more incompetent .

\\nThere are two financial sectors where more extensive regulation might have made a difference . \\nThese are the investment banks and the government-sponsored enterprises Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . \\nBoth sectors were major players in the events leading up to the crisis . \\nIn 2004 , the Securities and Exchange Commission adopted a rule that pretty much allowed investment banks to regulate themselves . \\nWhile a number of other factors were involved in this decision , the commission 's belief was that self-regulation would be more effective than SEC regulation . \\nThis was consistent with the free-market ideology of the Republican administration . \\nIn 2003 , Congress defeated efforts to bring Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac under tighter regulatory control . \\nThis was primarily the work of Democrats , who feared that tighter regulation would crimp the ability of the mortgage-market companies to meet affordable-housing goals . \\nI call it a tie between the two parties . \\nI hasten to add that had both financial sectors been subject to regulation , an only slightly less severe crisis would have occurred , for reasons explained below . \\nDeregulation , meaning the scrapping of existing regulations , was not a factor in the crisis . \\nThe only significant financial deregulation in the past three decades applied to commercial banks . \\nRestrictions on where they could have branches and on their involvement in investment banking were both removed . \\nMost economists , including me , believe that these actions made the banks stronger than they would have been otherwise . \\nRegulation in itself is a weak defense against financial crises . \\nOne major reason is that it tends to look backward , similar to generals fighting the last war . \\nThe savings-and-loan industry was subject to extensive regulation in the 1970s , but that did not prevent the subsequent crisis . \\nThe problem was that the wrong things were regulated . \\nThe regulatory system was geared to preventing S&Ls from taking on too much default risk because , historically , that had been the major problem . \\nThe exposure of S&Ls to interest rate risk was not controlled . \\nThe S&Ls were allowed , even encouraged , to make long-term , fixed-rate mortgages financed with short-term deposits . \\nWhen market interest rates exploded in the early 1980s , the cost of deposits jumped , income from mortgages barely changed and the industry began to bleed red ink . \\nThe policy changes that were introduced after the S&L crisis were largely designed to prevent another crisis of that type . \\nAmong other things , associations were authorized -LRB- and encouraged -RRB- to write adjustable-rate mortgages . \\nThis would make S&Ls , as well as banks , less vulnerable to swings in market rates . \\nHowever , ARMs carry more default risk than fixed-rate mortgages , and as the years passed , interest-only and payment-option ARMs evolved that carried substantially more default risk . \\nAs the system became increasingly secure against an interest rate shock , it became increasingly vulnerable to a default shock . \\nPreventing a default shock through existing regulatory tools would be difficult . \\nThe core tool is capital requirements : The amount of capital including reserves that firms are required to have to cover the risk of losses from future defaults . \\nThe problem is that nobody knows how large any future default shocks will be . \\nRegulators have no better foresight than do the firms they regulate . \\nBoth use statistical models based on experience . \\nA change in the underlying structure of the economy can make such history irrelevant , which is exactly what has happened . \\nNobody anticipated the severity of the current crisis because , relative to the past , it is off the chart . \\nBut does n't that mean that regulators , who are not motivated by profit , should err on the side of caution ? \\nTo a degree , yes . \\nIf that were not the case , regulation would be pointless . \\nBut capital requirements that are higher than needed to meet potential shocks not only reduce profits but also impose social costs , to which regulators are sensitive . \\nLarger capital requirements reduce loan volume and raise interest rates , a fact well understood by the congressmen who resisted tightening regulatory controls on Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac . \\nBetter regulatory tools are needed . \\nWe should take a hard look at applying the system used to regulate mortgage insurance companies to mortgage lenders . \\nUnder this system , lenders would be required to allocate a portion of every dollar they receive in interest above some base rate to a reserve account that would not be touchable for 10 years except in an emergency . \\nThe higher the interest rate , the larger the payment to the reserve account . \\nCan we prevent this sort of problem from happening again ?

'' \\nThe first of the four pandemics was Russian flu - each takes its name from the country where the first case was reported - which emerged in 1889 . \\nThis was well before the science of virology had even been conceived . \\nIt rapidly spread through Europe , and reached North America and Latin America , lasting until 1892 and eventually killing an estimated one million people . \\nMedical facilities were overwhelmed by the 1918 flu pandemic `` We have very little information about this strain , '' says Dr Morens . \\n`` But in the mid 1900s , scientists started collecting , and more importantly preserving , serum samples from people who had been alive during the flu pandemic . \\nSo there is now some evidence that it could have been an H3 virus . \\n`` If it turned out to be true that only limited types of influenza genes have the ability to work in a human virus , that would be important , because you could vaccinate the world 's population against the known possibilities of a pandemic virus , '' he says . \\nAlthough at its early stages , work is already progressing on a universal vaccine - one that would stimulate human immune systems to recognize , and raise antibodies against parts of the influenza virus shared by all strains . \\nBut , during the last century , the virus has shown a deadly ability to change beyond recognition . \\nIn 1918 , an influenza pandemic started that became a global disaster - eventually killing more people than the Great War . \\nEstimates of the death toll from the 1918 outbreak of Spanish flu range from 20 million to 40 million . \\nSome historians argue it could have been as high as 100 million . \\n`` There was a mild wave in the spring , but the very serious , lethal wave was in the autumn to the winter , '' says Professor Markel . \\n`` Then a third wave in January to April 1919 , and a fourth wave in the winter of 1920 . '' \\nThis tendency for `` waves '' of infection and re-infection makes the virus yet more unpredictable . \\nNew vaccines for circulating strains are now designed every year At the time the medical consensus was that the disease was caused not by a virus , but by a bacterium called Haemophilus influenzae . \\nSo some countries , including the US and UK , distributed vaccinations against the wrong disease-causing agent . \\n`` Another problem was that the authorities stuck their heads in the sand , '' says Mr Honigsbaum . \\n`` Their priority was the war and they did n't have the resources to deal with the health crisis . \\n`` There 's an argument that if they 'd been more proactive , and diverted doctors and nurses from the front to civilian needs , they could have saved more lives . '' \\nDr Morens refers to the 1918 H1N1 strain as `` the mother of all pandemics '' . \\n`` In the category of Influenza A , which is the category of virus that has caused all human epidemics and pandemics , every virus circulated since 1918 has been a descendent of this virus in one way or another , '' he says . \\n`` Descendants of the 1918 pandemic are still infecting human beings , but they have mutated again and again and again to be able to survive . '' \\nThe 1918 influenza pandemic gripped a vulnerable , unprepared human population , but its ability to `` reassort '' - or exchange its genes with other viruses - was what made it `` dangerously novel '' . \\nWe had two lineages of the disease , both of which have persisted National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases `` Every species has its own flu - when those species live together , and they can transmit their flu to different species , the virus itself changes its structure , '' says Professor Markel . \\nSince our immune systems recognize and respond mainly to the H and N part of the molecule , scientists suspect that pandemics arise when a strain emerges with a big change in the structure of one of these proteins . \\nBut how exactly the virus adapts to enable it to attach to receptors on the cells of a different species , is an `` unanswerable '' question , says Dr Morens . \\n`` With only four pandemics in over 100 years , our sample size is too small to say , but it seems that a new H -LRB- on the surface of the virus -RRB- has been the major factor , '' says Dr Morens . \\n`` We do n't know where the 1918 virus came from , but the evidence is that it was a new virus . \\n`` At the same time that it infected humans , it also infected pigs . \\nAnd at that point , we began to have two lineages of that disease - the human virus , and the pig virus , which persisted too , '' he adds . \\nThe progeny of the 1918 influenza strain evolved and mutated as they were transmitted from one host to another . \\nAnd on two further occasions , these strains incorporated completely new genes and spread globally once again . \\n`` That 's what happened in 1957 and 1968 - a hybrid formed of the 1918 virus with genes that were never part of it before , '' says Dr Morens . \\nIn the case of the 1957 Asian flu outbreak , a human H2N2 virus combined with the genes of a strain found in wild ducks . \\nThe pandemic killed an estimated one million people worldwide . \\nAn outbreak of H3N2 Hong Kong flu in 1968 , when avian and human virus genes combined once again , claimed another million lives . \\nIn both cases , the impact was minimized by health authorities , who identified the virus , and made vaccines available . \\n`` Now , every year , around summer time , a group of flu experts get together and see what strains are circulating so they can design an appropriate vaccine , '' says Dr Markel . \\nAnd in the last few years , principally because of the global concern about avian flu , anti-viral drugs that target influenza , such as Tamiflu , have been introduced . \\nThe emergence of a virus that crosses a species barrier is extremely rare But Professor Markel points out that , despite having reached new levels of medical preparation , `` we live in a world of emerging infectious diseases '' . \\n`` We have learned to take avian flu very seriously , and we have learned to take the animal kingdom very seriously , '' he says . \\nBut in the rare event that a virus does develop that is able to cross the species barrier , he points out that the close proximity of domestic farm animals to humans provides an opportunity for human infection . \\n`` Human beings travel farther and faster than ever before . \\nAll of this means that we are set up for a potential epidemic or pandemic , '' concludes Professor Markel . \\n`` We learn more every time , but the story of flu pandemics is still very much a story in progress .

boss Tony Hayward met with an Abu Dhabi state investment fund on Wednesday , part of a quest for cash to ward off takeovers and help pay for the worst oil spill in U.S. history . \\nThe action on Thursday was set to move back to the courts with the oil drilling industry going head-to-head with the Obama administration over the White House effort to suspend deepwater oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico for six months in the wake of the catastrophic well blowout . \\n-LRB- nN07171381 -RRB- Hayward , BP 's chief executive , was seen by Reuters with a senior official from another Abu Dhabi fund , and a report said Saudi investors were looking to buy 10 percent to 15 percent of the British oil company . \\nA United Arab Emirates official said Hayward 's visit with the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority -LRB- ADIA -RRB- was a routine one . \\nAn ADIA spokesman declined comment . \\n`` We are here to talk to our existing shareholders , '' a cheerful-looking Hayward told Reuters in the ornate , marble lobby of an Abu Dhabi office building before heading into a meeting , along with his six-man entourage . \\nBut bankers say BP is on a marketing drive for its stock , whose price has fallen by half since its well blew out in April , spewing crude oil into the Gulf of Mexico and soiling the shores of every U.S. Gulf Coast state . \\nHayward was in Azerbaijan on Tuesday . \\nBP 's shares on the New York Stock Exchange closed up almost 4 percent , buoyed by investor relief the company had said it does not plan to issue new equity , and speculation the worst is behind for what they see as an underpriced energy giant . \\n`` With the CEO in Abu Dhabi speaking to the sovereign wealth fund to get some investment , it 's not surprising that there is some enthusiasm in the market for BP shares , '' said Mic Mills , head of electronic trading at London-based ETX Capital . \\nProgress on the relief well , seen as the best hope for finally stopping the 79-day-old disaster , also lifted investor hearts . \\nThe U.S. official overseeing the spill cleanup said it was 15 feet from the side of the leaking well , although still not expected to be finished before mid-August . \\nThe spill is wreaking havoc on coastal ecosystems , killing birds , sea turtles and dolphins and risking multibillion-dollar fishing and tourist industries at a time of high unemployment . \\nAs a result , it sits atop U.S. President Barack Obama 's crowded domestic agenda and has sternly tested his leadership . \\nOn Thursday , the next big round will play out in court in the fight between the drilling industry and the White House over its efforts to suspend offshore drilling . \\nGiven the business and environmental stakes , the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans is expected to rule quickly , after a rare one-hour oral argument , on whether deepwater drilling should be temporarily halted again . \\nA federal judge , also in New Orleans , lifted the moratorium last month after Hornbeck Offshore Services Inc argued it was arbitrary because it was a blanket ban on all new drilling in depths below 500 feet . \\nThe Obama administration appealed the decision , defending the suspension as needed to provide time to probe the BP oil spill 's cause and ensure other drilling rigs operate safely . \\nThe administration is seeking a stay of the judge 's ruling at the hearing , slated for 3 p.m. local time -LRB- 2000 GMT -RRB- on Thursday . \\nThe industry calls it an unnecessary infringement on its business that costs jobs . \\nThe U.S. Energy Information Administration said the ban will reduce crude output an average of 82,000 barrels per day , more than previously estimated . \\nBP 's Alaska unit said on Wednesday it will probably delay until 2011 development drilling at its offshore Liberty field . \\nIt had been due to start late this year . \\nA successful court challenge `` could give some of these -LRB- drillers ' -RRB- stocks a lift in the near term , '' said Channing Smith , co-portfolio manager of Tulsa , Oklahoma-based Capital Advisors Growth Fund . \\nThe Philadelphia oil services sector index is down about 25 percent from its 2010 high hit in late April . \\nThe European Union 's energy chief said in Brussels that the bloc should consider its own moratorium on new deepwater oil drilling until after a probe into the BP spill . \\nEstimates of the leak 's severity vary widely , to as high as 100,000 barrels per day . \\nA new collection vessel that should more than double BP 's oil-capture capacity to 53,000 barrels a day from around 25,000 is projected to take three more days to hook up , as rough seas hamper efforts to finish the job . \\nWith the region settling into the six-month hurricane season , forecasters were watching a weather system over the southern Gulf that could develop into a tropical depression and hit the coast near the Texas-Mexico border on Thursday . \\nPushed by the Obama administration , BP has committed to a $ 20 billion fund for clean-up and other costs stemming from the spill . \\nIts costs to date have topped $ 3 billion . \\nThe final bill may depend on how much crude pours from the well , which blew when a rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers . \\nSo containment efforts are keenly watched . \\nBP executives have held talks with sovereign wealth funds in Abu Dhabi , Kuwait , Qatar and Singapore , seeking a partner that might help it avoid being taken over , a UAE source said . \\nAbu Dhabi 's International Petroleum Investment Company , was not interested in buying a BP stake , a company source said . \\nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \\nThe first target is to concentrate power to close that oil hole far 1500 meters from surface ships . \\nWhat is happening seems a slow rallenty of eleven september2001 tragedy . \\nI 'm crying every hour with my child -LRB- five years -RRB- for what is happening

gas tight and electrical problems ... . \\nit is not thje first time . \\nBut I am quite sure that the real criminal act of BP is their intention to continue to collect oil instead to stop it definitely and then drill again . \\n... But as now we can program the positive act to close the leak completely : It is easy to be closed when the bottom area around this hole is free from interference objects : solution is to clean the area with the power of us coast guards and us navy . \\nThe removal of all piping interferences and strange inventions to have an horizontal and clean area around the hole . \\nThe column of water above this hole is 150 atm of pressure and can be used on a crown steel horizontal plate welded around a below positioned plug . \\nThe pressure of water is on a steel larger area pushing on the bottom around the hole and the pressure from gas\\/oil is on the plug only . \\nLike a cap `` sombrero '' . \\nThis is enough to close this hole . \\nWhithout losses of money and energies of great men who are fighting against effects of the oil invasion . \\nPlease understand this simple concept which is not be taken in consideration enough . \\nI am still confused if the pressure of oil coming out from the hole is more than 100 psi and the blow up was due to the pressure how then drilling a relief hole can be safeguarded so that we do not have another problem like the earlier one . \\nCan someone kindly explain Jul 07 , 2010 6:50 am EDT -- Report as abuse This discussion is now closed . \\nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \\nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "The British Petroleum logo is seen near a petrol station in Dubai with the Burj Khalifa tower in the background on July 7, 2010.", "prop_score_1": 0.5, "generate_explanation_1": "The original sentence is written in a casual, conversational tone and includes some colloquial expressions (\"BP boss Tony Hayward,\" \"a report said,\" \"a UAE source said\").

Paulson Jr. to devise responses to the most critical events of the market turmoil , including the bailouts of the investment bank Bear Stearns and the insurance giant American International Group . \\nLike Paulson , Geithner believes that the Treasury should be given vast powers to develop experimental strategies for responding to the crisis and the flexibility to abandon them if they do n't work . \\nGeithner 's mentor is Lawrence H.

'' \\n`` I ca n't tell you how much oil is in the plume , '' he noted , so it does n't contradict the government 's report that only 26 % of the leak remains . \\nAnd the picture will change as more chemical analysis is done , Reddy pointed out . \\nBut one thing is clear : There 's definitely still oil down there . \\n`` We 've shown conclusively not only that a plume exists , but also defined its origin and near-field structure , '' said Richard Camilli the other lead researcher from WHOI , of the 1.2 mile wide , 650 foot high plume . \\nThe team 's observations were made during a June 19-28 scientific cruise aboard the National Science Foundation owned ship Endeavor . \\nIt was halted by the onset of hurricane Alex.

'' \\nThe Butler report placed such matters as proper procedure right at the heart of Blair 's prime ministerial `` role in the modern society '' . \\nOn July 20 2004 , six days after Butler was published , Blair was on his feet in the Commons undertaking to implement its procedural recommendations . \\nThe constitutional anorak suddenly fitted the prime ministerial shoulders . \\n`` Prior to the war , '' he said , `` meetings were held with an informal group , including the foreign and defense secretaries , the chief of the defense staff , the head of the Secret Intelligence Service , the chairman of the JIC , and my foreign policy adviser . \\nIn any future situation , such a group , which brought together the key players required to work on operational military planning and developing the diplomatic strategy , will operate formally as an ad hoc cabinet committee . '' \\nIn his report , Lord Butler showed that the government 's fundamental shift in the spring of 2002 from a policy of containing Saddam Hussein to one designed `` to enforce disarmament '' was not based on any new development in the current intelligence picture on Iraq . \\nSimilarly , in the run-up to the war , Goldsmith -LRB- who eventually judged it legal without a further , specific UN resolution authorising the use of force -RRB- warned his ministerial colleagues that `` there would be no justification for the use of force against Iraq on grounds of self-defence against an imminent threat '' . \\nOne of the impressive aspects of the Butler report was the way his committee followed the intelligence trail into the attorney general 's office and assessed the degree to which it did or did not shape his advice to the prime minister 's group on Iraq and to the cabinet . \\nThe attorney general 's legal opinion has not been published in full . \\nAll parliament has been given is a written answer from Goldsmith , with an accompanying summary prepared by the Foreign Office , dated March 17 2003 . \\nThe Butler committee has seen the opinion in full . \\nWhat we did not know until Butler appeared before the select committee on October 21 2004 was that initially the government had been unwilling to show it to Butler 's committee of privy counsellors . \\nAs Butler put it : `` There were moments when we had a bit of tension with the government about whether they were going to disclose documents to us . \\nOne of the examples of that was the attorney general 's legal opinion . \\nHad we gone public and said , ` We think this is relevant to our committee and the government will not give use access to it , ' we would have had huge public and media support . \\nThat was an important leverage on the government . '' \\nButler 's revelation was striking in itself . \\nBut it also suggested that Goldsmith 's opinion , which led to the resignation of Elizabeth Wilmshurst , the FO 's foremost expert on the legality of military operations , was even more finely balanced than we had thought . \\nMissing from the Butler report is the information that it was not ministers who requested that final legal opinion from Goldsmith . \\nIt was the senior military and top civil servants in the Ministry of Defense who did so . \\nCan the full cabinet really have tested Goldsmith 's opinion when , as Butler reported , the attorney general set out his view on the legal position to the cabinet on March 17 2003 , by producing and speaking to the written answer he gave to parliament on that date ? \\nFor me , this and the other accumulations of failures to scrutinise and question in the privacy of the cabinet room amounts to a dereliction of cabinet government comparable only to 1956 . \\nThen Eden 's cabinet did not press him at the height of the Suez crisis on the significance of his telling them that `` from secret conversations which had been held in Paris with representatives of the Israeli government , it now appeared that the Israelis would not alone launch a full-scale attack against Egypt '' . \\nFrom these remains you did not need a background in British intelligence to sniff out the collusion between the UK , France and Israel , which Eden subsequently flatly denied in the Commons . \\nFor me , Goldsmith 's March 2003 opinion on the legality of the Iraq war remains the fault-line under the Blair government . \\nLike the permanent stain of Suez on Eden 's reputation , it will not be eradicated from the memory of the Blair premierships for generations to come . \\nThe ultimate systems failure in both instances occurred at proper , formal cabinet meetings . \\nIf the full cabinet will not take on a dominant prime minister in full cry , there is no other part of the system of government that can compensate for such supineness . \\nThe Commons , even if it is permitted a specific vote on peace and war -LRB- as it was in 2003 -RRB- , is not going to possess a range and detail of knowledge comparable to that of ministers . \\nIn the Commons last July , Blair promised to tighten up his procedures if , heaven forbid , he should contemplate leading his country into another war of pre-emption . \\nIt was a welcome recognition that Butler 's concerns were justified . \\nBut can it make any difference if cabinet ministers will not , in a phrase beloved of Roy Jenkins , `` rise to the level of events '' ? \\nWith a few big exceptions in the cabinet room , such as Gordon Brown and John Prescott , power and place come courtesy of Blair alone . \\n`` Tony wants '' usually means that `` Tony gets '' . \\nWill the Butler report really change those ingrained habits on the part of the dispenser and the receivers of patronage ? \\nOnly , I suspect , if the engines of war are cranked up once more . \\nPeter Hennessy is Attlee professor of contemporary British history , Queen Mary , London . \\nThis is an edited version of an article in the current issue of the Political Quarterly www.blackwellpublishing.com Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Peter Hennessy : The blame for the Iraq war lies with our supine cabinet This article was published on guardian .

'' \\n-LRB- In other words , the supreme authority in law is God . -RRB- \\n`` The judiciary is independent , with no power above it other than the law .

Monday , 25 January 2010 BBC World Service has begun broadcasting a daily 20-minute program for Haiti . \\n \\nThe service is aimed at providing information to people caught up in the devastation caused by the devastating earthquake in Haiti . \\nThe program will be produced and edited by a BBC team in Miami . \\nIn a special post for the Over To You blog , the BBC 's Nick Miles describes the challenges he and his team have had to overcome to put out the lifeline program : It 's been an extremely swift launch of a new radio service to say the least . \\nIt was only about four days from the first ideas being jotted down on a piece of paper to the program , Connexion Haiti , going on air . \\nBut it had to be quick . \\nThe need for information in Haiti is acute and many of the local stations are still off air so Connexion Haiti is providing an important service for Haitians . \\nWhen we arrived at the BBC offices here in Miami last Thursday we already knew we had two Haitian Americans living in Miami who would present the program . \\nWe also had a means of transmitting the program via six FM frequencies across Haiti . \\nThe frequencies are normally used by Radio France International for their broadcasts and they kindly stepped in to help the our program gone on air . \\nConnexion Haiti now also goes out on short wave and can he heard via the BBC Caribbean service website . \\nWe broadcast a trial program on Friday morning to test the signal and tell people how they could listen across Haiti and what they could expect from the program . \\nSo , with some of the logistics sorted out , we then had to decide what to put in Connexion Haiti . \\nA man listens to a radio at a refugee camp in Port-au-Prince , Haiti . \\nPicture : Associated Press We knew this was would be a lifeline service for Haitians and we needed to provide as much up-to-the-minute information as possible about where people could find food aid , clean water , medical assistance and shelter . \\nWe pulled together that information from , among other sources , our BBC correspondents in Haiti along with the main aid organizations and the US military . \\nWe set about getting a list of people we could interview in the Haitian language , Creole . \\nWe wanted to speak to as many people as we could who were working for the relief program in Haiti to give an idea of where the new distribution points for aid were and where new field hospitals were situated . \\nBut we 've also used the interviews to broadcast appeals from the humanitarian organizations , specifically appeals for people to remain calm and to make sure they do n't block any of the the main roads that might prevent aid getting through . \\nConnexion Haiti is also about hearing from ordinary Haitians caught up in the earthquake to find our how they 're coping and what they need . \\nTo make this happen we set up a dedicated email address for our listeners , along with a number they could text and another where they could leave recorded messages . \\nSo far the response has been encouraging . \\nWe 've received texts emails and calls from Haitians saying that they 're listening to the program . \\nSome have told us how they survived the earthquake while sadly members of their family did not . \\nOthers have left telephone numbers so that loved ones can get in touch . \\nOthers have just emailed to say how important the service is for them because they know that the world cares about what 's happened in Haiti . \\nWe 've tried to broadcast as many of these messages as we can . \\nThe program 's only twenty minutes long , and in that short time we want to get as much crucial information to people as possible but we 've also tried to include items that show the people of Haiti that people around the world are thinking about them and taking concrete actions to help . \\nIn our first broadcast , for example , we ended the program with the music of Haitian pop star Wyclef Jean playing at an international charity concert for Haiti . \\nHe bellowed out his solidarity with his compatriots and perhaps that in some small way will give psychological boost to the people of Haiti who are living such desperate times . \\nNick Miles is Producer , BBC Connexion Haiti Over To You is your chance to have your say about the BBC World Service and its programs . \\nIt airs at 10:40 and 23:40

' \\nHis solution seemed simple : to bombard the Portuguese regime with written protests . \\nAs Martin Ennals , a future Amnesty secretary-general observed later , it was ` an amazing contention that prisoners of conscience could be released by writing letters to governments ' . \\nBut rather than have just one campaign for one country , why not draw public attention to the plight of political and religious prisoners throughout the world ? \\nThis was the basis of his Observer article , which took the shape of a series of letters published as an ` Appeal for Amnesty ' . \\nHis article began : ` Open your newspaper - any day of the week - and you will find a report from somewhere in the world of someone being imprisoned , tortured or executed because his opinions or religion are unacceptable to his government . \\nThe newspaper reader feels a sickening sense of impotence . \\nYet if these feelings of disgust all over the world could be united into common action , something effective could be done . ' \\nHe could not have predicted how right he has proved to be . \\nBenenson had intended his campaign to run for a year , but the response to his article was overwhelming . \\nThe term ` prisoner of conscience ' , which he coined , soon became common currency and the movement 's logo , a candle surrounded by barbed wire , became a worldwide symbol of hope . \\nAmnesty 's campaigns have saved countless prisoners from torture or death . \\nFrom South Africa , Chile and Uganda to Iraq , Burma and China , Amnesty 's work has helped secure the release of political prisoners and highlighted human rights violations . \\nCloser to home Amnesty has also been critical of policies of the former prime minister , Margaret Thatcher , and more recently Tony Blair 's anti-terrorist legislation . \\nIrene Khan , its present secretary general , said yesterday : ` His vision gave birth to human rights activism . \\nPeter Benenson 's life was a courageous testament to his visionary commitment to fight injustice around the world . \\nHe brought light into the darkness of prisons , the horror of torture chambers and tragedy of death camps around the world . \\n` This was a man whose conscience shone in a cruel and terrifying world , who believed in the power of ordinary people to bring about extraordinary change and , by creating Amnesty International , he gave each of us the opportunity to make a difference . ' \\nThe Leader of the House of Commons , Peter Hain , a long-time campaigner against the former apartheid regime in South Africa , led the political tributes last night . \\n` He lit a torch for human rights which Amnesty International has kept burning across the world in being constantly vigilant about abuses , ' Hain said . \\nIn Amnesty 's first few years Benenson 's energy was vital to its success . \\nHe provided much of its funding and was involved in all aspects of the organization . \\n` At that time we were still putting our toes in the water and learning as we went on , ' he later said . \\n` We tried every technique of publicity and we were very grateful for the widespread help of journalists and television crews throughout the world who not only sent us information about the names of prisoners but also , whenever they could , gave space to stories about prisoners . ' \\nAmnesty 's membership is now more than a million , with supporters in more than 160 countries and territories . \\nIt has dealt with the cases of 47,000 prisoners of conscience and other victims of human rights violation . \\nMore than 45,000 of these are now closed . \\nIn 1977 Amnesty International was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for its tireless fight against injustice . \\nFormer prisoner of conscience Julio de Pena Valdez , a trade union leader in the Dominican Republic , has spoken of the impact of an Amnesty letter-writing campaign . \\n` When the 200 letters came , the guards gave me back my clothes . \\nThen the next 200 letters came and the prison director came to see me . \\nWhen the next pile of letters arrived , the director got in touch with his superior . \\nThe letters kept coming and coming - 3,000 of them . \\nThe president was informed . \\n` The letters still kept arriving and the president called the prison and told them to let me go . ' \\nBenenson was born on 31 July 1921 , the grandson of the Russian-Jewish banker Grigori Benenson . \\nHe later converted to Catholicism . \\nHe was tutored privately by WH Auden , then went to Eton and Oxford , where he studied history . \\nHis flair for controversy emerged early , when his complaint to the headmaster of Eton about the poor quality of the school 's food prompted a letter to his mother warning of her son 's ` revolutionary tendencies . \\nAt age 16 , he launched his first campaign : to get school support , during the Spanish Civil War , for the newly-formed Spanish Relief Committee which was helping Republican war orphans . \\nHe himself ` adopted ' one of the babies , helping to pay for its support . \\nHis concern about political imprisonment and mistreatment was inspired by Arthur Koestler 's Spanish Testament , which described the horrors of imprisonment and threatened execution by the Fascists . \\nIt was this concern that led to his next campaign - the plight of Jews who had fled from Hitler 's Germany . \\nDespite some opposition , he succeeded in getting his school friends and their families to raise # 4,000 to bring two young German Jews to Britain . \\nAfter leaving Eton , he helped his politically committed mother find homes in various countries for refugee children who arrived in London . \\nThe Trades Union Congress sent him to Spain as its observer at the trials of trade unionists in the early Fifties . \\nHe was appalled by what he saw in the courtrooms and in the prisons . \\nIn one instance he was so outraged by the proceedings that he drew up a list of complaints with which he confronted the trial judge over dinner . \\nThe trial ended with acquittals , a rarity in fascist Spain . \\nBenenson , who had been ill for some time , died on Friday evening at the John Radcliffe Hospital , Oxford . \\nLighting a candle in St Martin-in-the Fields church to mark the twentieth anniversary of Amnesty , he said : ' I have lit this candle , in the words of Shakespeare , ` against oblivion ' - so that the forgotten prisoners should always be remembered . \\nWe work in Amnesty against oblivion .

But more sophisticated tests must be done to show whether it is an H1N1 , the type that includes both one of the seasonal influenza strains and the new swine flu strain . \\nEven further testing will show if it is the new strain , but this requires either a process called PCR , which amplifies and analyzes the genetic material of the virus , or using a test called an antibody test to see if the patient 's immune system has mounted a defense against the virus . \\n`` What is being rolled out right now by the CDC is a specific test for this new virus , '' said the CDC 's Dr. Lyle Petersen . \\nIt will fit onto the PCR platform used in state health departments for influenza surveillance and will produce a result in a matter of hours , Petersen said . \\nBut it is not something a doctor or clinic can do . \\n`` You need a fancy machine to do it , '' he said in a telephone interview . \\nFor now , the CDC recommends only that people with flulike symptoms who have some kind of recent travel to Mexico or who have been in close contact with a known swine flu patient should get the test . \\nPetersen said there is a limited amount of material , called reagent , that can be used to make the PCR tests work . \\nAnd if the disease is spreading , that will become clear anyhow . \\n`` No one is going to recommend doing wholesale testing anyway . \\nIf you have a giant outbreak of flu you do n't need to test every single person if you know what it is , '' he said . \\n-LRB- Reporting by Maggie Fox , Editing by Sandra Maler -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "New tests are being shipped to U.S. states that should speed up efforts to screen for the new flu virus that threatens to start a pandemic, health officials said on Thursday.", "prop_score_1": 0.5, "generate_explanation_1": "The original sentence uses language that is too generic and doesn't convey the urgency of the situation.

Despite the regime's cautious foreign policy and economic liberalization, the situation in Egypt remains unstable, with a tenuous political environment that can quickly turn into anger and action. The unpreparedness of the regime's political opponents and the lack of institutional structure in the liberal movement make it unlikely that the situation will descend into chaos, but the uncertainty surrounding Egypt's future is intensified by the approaching presidential election and the interaction between the regime, political Islam, and the liberal movement.

Thad Allen , said Thursday that the mud was stopping some oil and gas but had a ways to go before it proved successful . \\nThe top kill started Wednesday night and it could be several days before officials know if it is working . \\n`` As you inject your mud into it , it is going to stop some hydrocarbons , '' Russell said . \\n`` That does n't mean it 's successful .

'' \\nHis statement followed a poll by CBS News yesterday which found 70 % disapproval of BP 's handling , and 45 % unhappy with the Obama administration 's response . \\nYesterday , Salazar reiterated that BP will be `` held accountable '' for compensation and government costs . \\nThe oil company may find itself having to answer further questions today , after revelations that just days before the Deepwater Horizon explosion the company had chosen to use the riskier of two types of casing for the leaking well . \\nThe New York Times reported the existence of a BP document , given to the paper by a Congressional investigator , which noted the casing that the company had chosen was described in the document as the `` best economic case '' , despite BP admitting it carried risks beyond the potential gas leaks . \\nGreg McCormack , director of the Petroleum Extension Service at the University of Texas at Austin , told the newspaper that BP 's decision was `` without a doubt a riskier way to go '' , an assessment which the New York Times reported several other engineers had agreed with . \\nA BP spokesman argued that the Deepwater Horizon approach had not been unusual . \\nHayward yesterday visited the scene of the environmental disaster in Port Fourchon in southern Louisiana , where he said he was `` absolutely gutted '' that the crude oil had started to wash ashore . \\n`` As I said , it 's clear that the defense of the shoreline , at this point , has not been successful , '' Hayward said . \\n`` I feel devastated by that , absolutely gutted . \\nWhat I can tell you is that we are here for the long haul . \\nWe are going to clean every drop of oil off the shore . \\nJust days after a top US official suggested that BP faced an `` existential crisis '' , Hayward conceded : `` I think this is clearly a major reputational issue for BP .

'' \\nAt a midday news conference , the administration rolled out two Cabinet chiefs and other senior White House advisers to assert that the government would do whatever it could to help BP stop the leak . \\nThe administration is well aware that the president 's campaign victory was built in part on a belief among voters that he would do a better job at responding to disasters like Hurricane Katrina than did President Bush . \\n`` This is in that list : Are you competently running government ? '' \\nHe said the news conference with senior officials was aimed at letting the press and the public `` know what we 've done to respond . '' \\nJanet Napolitano , secretary of the Department of Homeland Security , said there were more than 50 vessels as well as aircraft deployed to the area of the spill and that workers had laid down 174,060 feet of absorbent foam booms and recovered 18,180 barrels of an oily mixture from the gulf 's surface . \\nShe said they would also open a second command center in Mobile , Ala. , in addition to the one in Louisiana . \\nThe Navy said it is sending 66,000 feet of inflatable boom and seven skimming systems , and would offer its bases in the region as staging areas for the operation . \\nWhite House officials said they began holding regular conference calls with BP executives soon after the accident . \\nOn Thursday , Obama also called the governors of the five Gulf Coast states , and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar met with oil and gas industry executives to appeal for ideas and help . \\nLouisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal declared a state of emergency and mobilized National Guard troops . \\nOn Friday , Napolitano , Salazar and EPA Administrator Lisa P. Jackson will travel to the Gulf Coast at the president 's request with Carol Browner , the White House director of energy and climate change policy , and Jane Lubchenco , head of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , to inspect ooperations dedicated to minimizing environmental risks . \\nDespite these efforts , it remained possible that the oil leak could continue for as long as three months , by which time it would rival the size of the 1989 spill from the Exxon Valdez . \\nIf efforts to reactivate the blowout-preventer fail , BP will try to lower 100-ton domes on top of the leaks in the pipes now lying on the sea floor and funnel the oil up through pipes to storage vessels . \\nSuch methods have been used before , but generally at depths of 350 feet or less . \\nBP also plans to start drilling a relief well Friday that would intercept the oil from the existing well and plug the leak , but the company said that could take several weeks . \\nIt took more than two months to plug a similar well blowout off the coast of Australia late last year . \\nBy that time , the damage from the spill could be extensive and the political effect on Obama 's offshore drilling plan and broader climate change agenda uncertain . \\n`` I do n't know whether it changes our understanding of offshore oil , '' David Pumphrey , deputy director of the energy and national security program at the Center for Strategic and International Studies , said of the accident . \\n`` But I think it changes the political debate quite a bit . '' \\nIn backing wider offshore oil and gas exploration only a month ago , Obama promised to `` employ new technologies that reduce the impact of oil exploration . '' \\nHe acknowledged that his decision would provoke criticism from those who decried the expansion and those who said it did not go far enough . \\n`` Ultimately , we need to move beyond the tired debates of the left and the right , between business leaders and environmentalists , between those who would claim drilling is a cure-all and those who would claim it has no place , '' Obama said . \\nThe accident in the gulf may provide more firepower for the critics on the left who for years have lobbied presidents and Congress to keep in place federal moratoriums on further offshore exploration . \\nThose moratoriums have expired . \\nFlorida Sen. Bill Nelson -LRB- D -RRB- called on Obama to step back from his expanded offshore drilling plans . \\nIn a letter to the president , Nelson said he would file legislation to ban the Interior Department from following through on Obama 's proposal for new seismic and drilling activity . \\nHe said the gulf spill `` may be an environmental and economic disaster that wreaks havoc for commercial fishing and tourism along the Gulf of Mexico coast . '' \\nDan McLaughlin , a top aide to Nelson , said it was too early to say whether the federal government had responded adequately to what he called `` our worst nightmare come true . '' \\nBut McLaughlin asked why the government had not done more to ensure that the oil companies could shut down a well if a catastrophic failure happened . \\n`` Somebody is going to have to ask the question as to why the regulators did n't put this question to the industry before ? '' \\n`` If everything fails , then what ? '' \\nThat inquiry will likely focus on the blowout-preventer , which like the sunken drilling rig was owned by Transocean . \\nIn Norway , for example , blowout preventers are required to have a device known as an acoustic valve that can help assure activation in the event of an accident , but that device is n't required in the United States and was n't part of the blowout preventer used on this well . \\nBP Chief Executive Tony Hayward said Wednesday that the blowout preventer had been inspected 10 days before the accident . \\nThe Minerals Management Service , a part of the Interior Department that oversees safety on offshore rigs , said it would complete new inspections of all gulf exploration drilling rigs within seven days to prevent a repeat of the April 20 blast . \\nObama aides stressed at the midday briefing that BP would bear the cost of the spill , including the cost of plugging the well , cleaning shorelines and paying for government air and water tests . \\nSeparately , fishermen and others anticipating environmental damage filed class-action suits against the company . \\nOn a day when the stock market rose broadly and sharply , BP 's stock price fell more than 8 percent to $ 52.56 a share .

'' \\nLong-term health effects include neurological disorders and cancer . \\nSubra said there was even greater concern for those recruited to lay booms and skim crude off the water , since they were in closer proximity to the oil and the chemical dispersants . \\nClint Guidry , of the Louisiana Shrimp Association , has accused BP of threatening to sack workers who turn up wearing respirators . \\nThe oil firm said it was not aware of any workers being turned away , but noted that it was the responsibility of the Obama administration to decide whether such protective gear was warranted . \\nHugh Kaufman , chief investigator for the EPA 's ombudsman , said he encountered similar worker safety policies after 9\\/11 . \\n`` If people are wearing respirators , it scares people because they realize how toxic it is , '' he said `` The administration is down-playing the problem because it saves them money down the line . \\nIt was the same at Ground Zero . '' \\nEPA tests indicate that the combined effect of dispersants and crude oil are even more toxic than individually . \\n`` There are dispersants being applied by aeroplane and by boat , and these people on the water are being sprayed over and over again , '' Subra said . \\nFive offshore rigs have been shut down since the spill after workers fell ill . \\nSeven workers on a boat trying to scrub the oil from Breton Sound were taken to hospital on Wednesday , complaining of burning eyes , headaches , nausea , dizziness and chest pains . \\nFive were treated and released . \\nAdministration officials suggested in a conference call with reporters that the workers could be suffering from sunstroke in the hot Louisiana temperatures . \\nThey also said the workers recruited for the clean-up fishermen and shrimpers put out of work because of the spill had received training and wore protective gear . \\nHowever , the protective clothing does not include respirators , which environmental activists say violates safety regulations for workers exposed to dangerous chemicals . \\nNone of the workers pictured raking up oil from the beaches of Grand Isle Louisiana in photographs released by the Deepwater command center today was wearing a mask or respirator . \\nA version appeared on p6 of the Main section section of the Guardian on 02.03 BST on Saturday 29 May 2010 The latest news and comment from our team of reporters , writers and editors in the US Auto update every minute On | Off stuartmillar159 : I stand corrected RT @flashboy : @stuartmillar159 NO STUART THAT IS WHAT RAIN ACTUALLY IS ", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "BP's \"top kill\" operation to cap the ruptured well in the Gulf of Mexico could last for several days, with environmental scientists warning of long-term health effects from exposure to crude oil and chemical dispersants.", "prop_score_1": 0.5, "generate_explanation_1": "In this rewrite, I have changed the sentence structure and wording to make it more concise and clear.

Edward J. Markey , D-Mass . \\n, said he learned that it would be shut off while BP attempts the top kill . \\nBut BP said late Tuesday that it has agreed at the request of the Obama administration to show video of the top kill . \\nRecently , the video has shown the underwater plume getting significantly darker . \\nA top oil engineering expert says that suggests heavier , more-polluting oil is spewing out . \\nThe color of the oil gushing from the main pipe has changed in color from medium gray to black . \\nTwo scientists noticed the change , which oil company BP downplayed as a natural fluctuation that is not likely permanent . \\nIf the top kill does n't work , or makes the problem worse , BP will probably turn to a containment box resting on the seafloor . \\nIt is a smaller version of the 100-ton box the company lowered several weeks ago in hopes of capturing much of the oil . \\nThat larger device was clogged with ice crystals and BP had to abandon it , but the company hopes the smaller version might work better . \\nBP says it siphoned more oil with a mile-long tube after two days of falling totals from a leaking seafloor well in the Gulf of Mexico . \\nBP PLC spokesman John Curry told The Associated Press on Tuesday that the tube collected some 256,200 gallons of oil on Monday . \\nThe collections were further evidence that a previous estimate -- that the entire spill was 210,000 gallons a day -- was too low . \\nBP is complying with the government 's request to use less of a toxic dispersant in fighting the Gulf oil spill , but alternative dispersants are n't so readily available , the White House 's energy adviser said Tuesday . \\nIn a letter to BP last week , the Environmental Protection Agency gave the oil giant three days to find a less toxic alternative to the dispersant , Corexit 9500 , that it is using to break up the oil . \\nBut in a series of meetings that followed , White House energy adviser Carol Browner said , it became clear the alternatives were not as widely available as needed . \\nStaff members at an agency that oversees offshore drilling accepted tickets to sports events , lunches and other gifts from oil and gas companies and used government computers to view pornography , according to an Interior Department report alleging a culture of cronyism between regulators and the industry . \\nIn at least one case , an inspector for the Minerals Management Service admitted using crystal methamphetamine and said he might have been under the influence of the drug the next day at work , according to the report by the acting inspector general of the Interior Department . \\nThe report cites a variety of violations of federal regulations and ethics rules at the agency 's Louisiana office . \\nPrevious inspector general investigations have focused on inappropriate behavior by the royalty-collection staff in the agency 's Denver office . \\nPresident Barack Obama , seeking to show command of a crisis that has exasperated the nation , will head back to Louisiana on Friday to review efforts to stop the disastrous Gulf oil spill . \\nThe White House announced Obama 's trip but did not yet release details of

Bush 's credibility , the poisonous geyser at the Gulf 's floor threatens to undermine Barack Obama 's presidency . \\nMore alarmingly , the spill exacerbates the worry that this nation founded on the principle of trust now faces a crisis of faith in its public and private institutions -- government and big business particularly . \\n`` This spill , it 's another blow to the body politic , '' says John Baick , professor of history at Western New England College in Springfield , Mass. . \\nIt is , he says , another excuse to be cynical and uninvolved -- `` exactly the opposite of what has always been the American zeitgeist , a sense that we , collectively and through our institutions , can be something greater than ourselves . '' \\nIt 's hard to summon that rising-sun aspiration when the unemployment rate hovers near double digits . \\nWhen wars in Afghanistan and Iraq continue unabated . \\nWhen terrorists take aim from inside and outside U.S. borders . \\nWhen the U.S. Treasury writes massive IOUs to China and public schools write off millions of poorly educated children . \\nThen along comes the oil spill to remind people of why they do n't trust leaders -- and why so many Americans , looking for information and action , are turning instead to blogs , Twitter feeds and their friends . \\nConsider this revealing scene : With reddish-brown oil globs washing ashore at Fort Morgan , Ala. , Faith Kaiser and Bertice McPherson decided to do what generations of Americans have done when government ca n't -- or wo n't -- tackle a big problem : They handled it themselves . \\nBefore paid cleanup crews started work , the volunteers pulled on rubber gloves and picked up the gooey mess . \\nAs they did so , Kaiser said this : `` Six months from now the government will lie to us and say everything is fine . '' \\nAt the 1787 Constitutional Convention , Benjamin Franklin famously observed that he had been trying to determine throughout the debate whether a sun painted on George Washington 's chair was rising or setting . \\n`` But now at length , '' he said , `` I have the happiness to know that it is a rising and not a setting sun . '' \\nAnd with that , the Founders created a nation upon the fundamental principle of trust . \\nThey had an untested belief in the ability of people to lead themselves -- to choose leaders from their own ranks and to hold those leaders accountable . \\nEven our currency , once backed by the promise of precious metal , is today built upon a faith-based system called `` fiat '' -- a Latin term meaning `` let it be done . '' \\nIn a dictatorship , people can lose faith in institutions and the apparatus of state can step in . \\nBut democracy ca n't survive without faith in its institutions because the people , by definition , create and control them . \\nWhile there were surely crises of faith during the Civil War , the Progressive Era and others times of tumult , the early 20th century was marked by a reflexive sense of trust in the nation 's institutions . \\nEven as Franklin Roosevelt 's New Deal vastly expanded the government safety net , a new breed of private charities and social reformers did n't bother waiting on government to help the poor , infirm and abused . \\nBut things started to change in the mid-20th century , when polls showed a steady decline on the question of whether Americans trusted government in Washington to do what is right . \\nFrom 1958 , when more than 70 percent said they trusted government most or all of the time , the trend line steadily drops until it hits the mid-20s in the post-Watergate era . \\nThe trust line creeps up for a few years -- without getting nowhere near the 1958 mark -- and plunges again in 1994 , the year President Bill Clinton 's political faltering caused Democrats to lose control of Congress after more than 40 years in power . \\nJust two months ago , a Pew Research Center poll showed that only 22 percent of the public say they can trust the government in Washington always or most of the time , among the lowest measures in a half a century . \\n`` This spill has just got to make matters worse , '' said Pew pollster Andy Kohut . \\n`` People are asking , Who 's in charge ? \\nWhy ca n't they plug it ? \\nWhat going on here ? '' \\nJust 25 percent of the public has a favorable opinion of Congress . \\nFavorability ratings also have fallen significantly for seven of 13 federal agencies included in the Pew survey , including the Environmental Protection Agency . \\nFaith in institutions across the board has fallen since the 1970s , at least among the sample of institutions tracked by Gallup : churches , the U.S. Supreme Court , banks , public schools , newspapers , Congress and organized labor . \\nOne of the least-trusted institutions is big business , no surprise after corporate wrongdoing and lax government oversight combined to help create the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression . \\nSixteen percent of Americans said they had a `` great deal '' or `` quite a lot '' of confidence in big corporations in 2009 , compared to 32 percent 30 years prior . \\nThe only exception to this trend is the military , which has increased from a 54 percent favorability rating in the post-Vietnam era to 82 percent this year . \\nPart of the problem : Americans today might expect too much of government and other institutions . \\nTake the oil spill , for example . \\nAccidents happen and , right or wrong , the government is not in the drilling or drill-capping business . \\n`` I take responsibility . \\nIt is my job to make sure that everything is done to shut this down , '' Barack Obama declared a few days ago . \\nIn the same news conference , Obama also acknowledged his administration could have done better in dealing with the biggest oil spill in the nation 's history and misjudged the industry 's ability to cope with a worst-case scenario . \\nIt was a new twist for the U.S. presidency , an office normally filled by men who accept responsibility or admit fault only grudgingly . \\nObama may be recognizing that accountability breeds trust . \\nLess than two years removed from an election victory built on his promise to fix Washington 's broken institutions , Obama now seems a captive of them . \\nHis administration 's regulators cozied up to the oil industry before the spill and moved slowly afterward to seize control . \\nThe president himself often seemed detached . \\nWho else dropped the ball ? \\n-- BP and its chief executive , Tony Hayward . \\nAs his company 's oil filled up the Gulf , he had the audacity to complain that `` I 'd like my life back . '' \\n-- The Minerals Management Service , the regulatory agency that failed to clean up its act despite Obama 's promise during the campaign to end the `` cozy relationship '' between the oil industry and federal regulators . \\n-- Even the Coast Guard -- the one agency that survived Katrina with its image enhanced -- is now being criticized for its lack of transparency and command . \\nAnd the public stews . \\nListen to Billy Nugesser , president of the coastal Plaquemines Parish : `` We are dying a slow death here . '' \\nThe public 's unconditional faith in national institutions is dying , too . \\nWe ca n't buy a `` Shrek '' drinking glass at McDonald 's because it might be laced with cadmium . \\nWe ca n't talk about the Catholic church without wondering whether something untoward might be afoot . \\nWe ca n't watch a home run without wondering if our pro-ballplayer heroes are juiced . \\nWhich may be why an umpire 's blown call denying a rookie pitcher a historic `` perfect game '' became a viral story this week . \\nAmericans saw in the umpire 's apology and the pitcher 's gracious acceptance a sign that one of their institutions -- the made-by-America game of baseball -- still includes leaders who do the right thing even when the situation is less than perfect . \\nFrom their government , Americans do n't expect perfection . \\nBut the system requires that people at least have faith in their political leaders to be competent and accountable . \\n`` If people do n't believe , if people do n't give , if people do n't trust , they will pick the politicians who are the loudest rather than the most sincere , '' said Baick , the history professor . \\n`` They will pick the rabble rouser rather than the technocrat who gets things done .

\\nAs in the best political novels , the evidence and arguments are distributed with careful ambiguity . \\nThe novel is inevitably and properly clearer about its position on another internal debate . \\nPerowne , although an exemplar of the civilised upper middle classes , does n't believe in literature . \\nHe has no time to read and even becomes confused when his daughter Daisy , about to have her first poems published by Faber & Faber , uses the tricky jargon word `` stanza '' . \\nThe surgeon especially ca n't see the point of novels which tell you about someone 's life in great detail . \\nSurely it 's quite easy to note these things down and then type them out . \\nMcEwan gives Henry an even chance of victory on the squash court but , in this bit of sport about whether novels have a point , the novelist thrashes his hero in every line . \\nIn giving his central character not only a poet daughter and a father-in-law who writes verse but a wife who works at a newspaper , the writer could be accused of locating the story on home turf . \\nBut a considerable technical achievement of Saturday is that it succeeds in going inside the mind of a brain surgeon . \\nIn the early stages , there is a certain nervousness about whether the author is simply transcribing research notes - `` Then he let Rodney take the lead in another burr hole for a chronic subdural '' - but , by the end , there is no doubt that Perowne has the hands , eyes and thoughts of a neurosurgeon rather than a novelist . \\nMedical language , though , is only one of the registers in the prose . \\nMcEwan is one of the least flashy stylists of his generation , less quotable than Martin Amis or Julian Barnes , but , especially in Atonement and now this book , his voice has settled into scrupulous , sensual rhythms in which even something as simple as a 24-hour news bulletin is subject to careful choices of adjective and noun : `` The synthesised bleeps , the sleepless anchor and his dependable jaw . '' \\nIn a novel of great sureness at the level of both action and language , McEwan makes one curious choice : the quotations from Daisy Perowne 's debut volume of poetry are actually published lines by Craig Raine , giving the book an additional subplot in which , beyond the plot 's call on various sections of the Metropolitan police , you expect the literary cops to arrive and arrest Daisy for plagiarism . \\nIt 's a matter of debate whether it 's the reader or the writer who is being too clever here . \\nFor the rest of its length , though , Saturday gives no sense of McEwan 's talent taking a day off . \\nThe only consolation for McEwan 's contemporaries , I suppose , is that they could taunt him that he ca n't seem to write short stories any more . \\nMark Lawson 's Enough is Enough : Or the Emergency Government will be published by Picador later this year .

'' \\nThis series of public-relation gaffes meant Mr Hayward reportedly received intensive training for his appearance before addressing US politicians at a Congressional hearing in Washington last week . \\nIt did n't help , say critics . \\nHe was accused of dodging questions , the assumption being that he had been briefed by BP 's lawyers not to accept any responsibility . \\nBut that does n't mean you simply shut down , says Mr Brammer . \\n`` Trying to dodge things is ridiculous , it 's never a good reputation-management strategy . \\nEven when you do not want to accept responsibility , you can distinguish between the legal and the moral . \\nIt is never good to use the legal mechanism to prevent discourse .

'' \\nThe jury will hear testimony from dozens of witnesses , including some of those who were first on the scene , such as Jackson 's security guards and paramedics . \\nExperts will also be called upon to answer questions about Propofol , which will be at the heart of the case . \\nIt has been suggested by Dr Murray 's lawyers that the publicity surrounding the case could rise to the levels seen during the murder trial of the former American footballer-turned movie actor OJ Simpson in 1995 . \\nBut the judge has refused a request to have the jury sequestered , or confined to a hotel , to shield them from outside influences , as they were during the Simpson trial . \\nJermaine Jackson said he is prepared for a media `` circus '' Instead , Judge Michael Pastor has advised them not to `` read , listen to or watch any news report or any other commentary about this case from any source '' and to `` keep an open mind throughout '' . \\n`` I think the Conrad Murray trial will be the trial of the year -LRB- but -RRB- it will not be the trial of the century , '' says Linda Deutsch , a special correspondent with the Associated Press , and a veteran reporter at high profile cases in California . \\nWhile the defendant , Dr Murray , is not a celebrity , the trial will receive global attention because the alleged victim is Jackson , the superstar who is still worshipped by fans around the world . \\nThe proceedings , like the Simpson trial , are being televised . \\nMedia outlets from around the world set up makeshift studios near the court building . \\nHundreds of Jackson fans lined the street . \\nThere will be a lottery every morning to allocate seats in the public gallery . \\n`` The fact that it is Michael Jackson puts an entirely different profile on this case Michael Jackson was a fascinating man and he still fascinates even in death , '' says Ms Deutsch . \\nThe singer 's parents and famous siblings are all expected to make an appearance at LA 's Criminal Court building , taking it in turns to fill the eight seats the family has been allocated in the courtroom . \\nJackson 's three children will not attend the trial . \\n`` We 're ready , '' says his brother Jermaine Jackson , `` We 're always ready for whatever . \\nWe 've been raised and taught to take it as it comes .

'' \\nBut the Arab League could also decide to continue and bolster its mission , strengthening the hand of Russia , which has argued that the monitors are helping to stabilise the situation . \\n`` We think they 've established a foothold there , '' says Russian Ambassador Vitaly Churkin . \\n`` They 're in a better position than initially to have a restraining influence , so we hope they will continue beyond -LRB- one month -RRB- and as long as it takes for the political crisis to be brought to a halt . '' \\nIt is not only the Security Council that is divided : members of the Arab League are also far apart . \\nQatar is leading the drive against Syria , with quiet support from Gulf states . \\nOthers like Algeria , Iraq and , according to a Western diplomat , even Egypt may oppose any referral to the Council . \\nArab differences mirror the UN debate over the need for outside intervention and the desirability of regime change , even though they couch their concerns in the language of human rights . \\nAnalysts say the Sunni Muslim Gulf states see the end of the Assad regime as an opportunity to weaken Syria 's Shia Muslim ally Iran , which they perceive as a growing regional threat . \\nOther Arab governments see the end of the regime ushering in a sectarian and civil war that could suck in players from Israel to Iran . \\nFor them , supporting the Arab mission is a way of avoiding any international action that could contribute to the break-up of Syria : not necessarily through a Libya-like Nato operation but through punishing sanctions , no-fly or buffer zones , or the creation of safe havens for the opposition . \\nFor these states , the emergence of an armed resistance in Syria is every bit as alarming as the government 's repression . \\nSome Arab countries say the monitors are having trouble with the armed resistance `` The feeling is that the Syrian government is in the process of making more of an effort , but the Arab League is especially having problems with the armed opposition and is not managing to penetrate neighborhoods that are today belonging to the opposition , '' Algerian Foreign Minister Mourad Medelci told journalists at the UN recently . \\nGiven these divisions , the Arab League foreign ministers may be unable to come to a definitive conclusion about their monitoring mission when they meet at the weekend . \\n`` The most likely -LRB- scenario -RRB- is a fuzzy outcome , '' says one Western diplomat , `` but then we would have to take stock of our options : we are not planning to let this drop . '' \\nIndeed , the West can not afford to let Syria drop . \\nSome of the ideas floating around here include requesting a special envoy of the Secretary General for Syria , or bringing the Qatari prime minister and Arab League secretary general to New York to brief the Security Council . \\nBut that would be no substitute for the strong resolution condemning and perhaps sanctioning the Syrian government that Western states believe is long overdue . \\nYet the bottom line remains that the strength of any Council action will depend on the strength of an Arab League mandate . \\nAnd without a clear Arab referral to the UN , Western nations will likely face a Russian veto for anything other than the weakest of resolutions . \\nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .

'' \\nBernanke nodded and smiled . \\n`` I 've actually been chairman for three years , '' he said when his turn came at the microphone , `` so those statistics are not quite as good as you made them out to be . '' \\nTrue enough : The drop in the S&P has been closer to 40 percent since Bernanke took over . \\nHistory will no doubt judge Bernanke as the man left holding the bag when maestro Alan Greenspan left the Fed . \\nBut the economic collapse seems to have had a salutary effect on Bernanke : The academic known for his bland answers and brown socks has been liberated in both word and deed . \\nThis student of the Great Depression has taken extreme and unprecedented actions to avert a modern-day sequel , and he 's taken the Fed chairman 's lexicon well beyond basis points and LIBOR and M1 and M2 . \\n`` I think we can break the back of this thing , '' he told the luncheon crowd yesterday . \\nHe did n't hesitate to say that economic indicators `` have been dismal '' and that unemployment , now 7.6 percent , will go `` above 8 for sure . '' \\n`` Extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures , '' the radicalized Fed chairman said . \\nTo prove that , he 's dropped interest rates to near zero and has the Fed lending directly to corporations and buying mortgage securities . \\nYesterday , Bernanke left the door wide open to the most radical step of all : nationalizing the banks . \\nPresident Obama over the weekend said a `` good argument '' could be made for Sweden 's temporary nationalization of banks . \\nAnd no less a free-market authority than Greenspan , in an interview with the Financial Times this week , said `` it may be necessary to temporarily nationalize some banks , '' calling this the `` least bad solution '' to the financial crisis . \\nWhen Bernanke was asked at lunch about his predecessor 's sentiments , he voiced no opposition to the idea . \\nWhile discouraging government ownership of banks `` for a protracted period , '' he offered no such objection to short-term nationalization . \\n`` Whatever actions may need to be taken , at one point or another , I think there 's a very strong commitment , on the part of the administration , to try to return banks or keep banks private or return them to private hands as quickly as possible , '' he said . \\nIt would have been hard to imagine Bernanke giving a green light to nationalization when he was an economist in the Bush White House . \\nHe was , after all , an architect of some of the policies that created the housing bubble and collapse . \\nHe bristled when asked yesterday `` what should be done about regulators who simply fail to regulate , like the Fed 's hands-off stance toward subprime mortgages ? '' \\n`` I 'll drop the innuendoes and the slurs and not get into that part , '' replied Bernanke , who was on the Fed 's board of governors earlier in the decade . \\nHe maintained that the Fed `` had no direct supervisory authority over what was happening in most subprime lenders .

'' \\nHe said plainly that the huge stimulus package just enacted wo n't `` lead to a sustained recovery '' if the banking system is n't stabilized . \\nAnd he volunteered that the Fed 's usual responses `` have proven insufficient '' to halt the fall . \\nThis time , the old professor came equipped with a personal anecdote to supplement his data . \\n`` The unemployment rate in the small town in South Carolina where I grew up has risen to 14 percent , '' he said , `` and I learned the other day that what had once been my family home has been recently put through foreclosure . '' \\nHe was armed with sharp rejoinders , too . \\nAsked whether it was a mistake to let Lehman Brothers fail , he shot back : `` Well , the word ` mistake ' implies choice or an option . '' \\nAnd he even indulged in a bit of economist humor when talking about the paradox of encouraging people to spend even though overspending caused the problem : `` Somebody once called this the Augustinian principle , which says something like , ` Let me be moral , but not quite yet .

Security Council resolution , a multinational military force and the symbolism of presidential statements and actions . \\nWith the military mission shifting Thursday to a new phase of full NATO control after initial U.S. leadership , divisions among alliance partners and within Congress became more evident , exacerbated by the administration 's differing military and political goals . \\nPresident Barack Obama continues to insist that arming the Libyan rebels remained an option under consideration , while NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen and French Defense Minister Gerard Longuet ruled it out . \\nAt House and Senate committee hearings , Republicans grilled Defense Secretary Robert Gates and Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Adm.

'' \\nWhile Carney said the United States and its allies would keep up pressure on Gadhafi 's government , he acknowledged that it was impossible to say when the mission would end . \\nRegardless of when , he said , `` the scope of the U.S. involvement will be limited '' and Obama continues to reject any possibility of sending in U.S. ground troops . \\nAt the same time , a former counterterrorism official confirmed the existence of a presidential finding that authorizes the Central Intelligence Agency to conduct operations supporting U.S. policy in Libya . \\nA presidential finding is a type of secret order authorizing some covert intelligence operations , and a former senior intelligence official said such operations could include `` advising on how to target the adversary , how to use the weapons they have , reconnaissance and counter surveillance . '' \\nTop administration officials distinguished between the military mission charged with protecting Libyan civilians and the other non-military efforts -- including sanctions , freezing assets and CIA operations -- aimed at hastening Gadhafi 's departure . \\n`` Does the United States have the capacity to unilaterally with military force produce regime change in Libya or another country ? \\nWe probably do , '' Carney told reporters . \\n`` Is that a desirable action to take when you have your eye on the long game here in terms of Libya 's future , the future ... interests of the United States and the region ? \\nNo. '' Obama 's dual-track policy , with the military coalition protecting Libyan civilians while the United States pursues `` as a political , diplomatic and economic policy '' the end of Gadhafi 's rule , is the best fit for the Libya situation , Carney insisted , citing the international backing for the military mission through a U.N. Security Council resolution and Arab League support . \\nCritics complained that it is both dishonest and a mistake for the military objective to differ from the policy objective . \\nAt a House Armed Services Committee hearing , Rep. Chris Gibson , R-New York , said the mission 's `` military and political goals are not harmonized , '' while Coffman called it `` just the most muddled definition of an operation probably in U.S. military history .

'' \\nIt has n't quite become a total disaster yet . \\nBut it 's hard to imagine it not being devastating , said Ed Overton , who heads a federal chemical hazard assessment team for oil spills . \\nThe Louisiana State University professor has been testing samples of the spilled crude . \\nHe compared what 's brewing to another all-too-familiar Gulf Coast threat : `` This has got all the characteristics of a Category 5 hurricane . '' \\nIf conditions do n't change quickly , devastation of the highest magnitude is headed for somewhere along the coast , said Overton , who works with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . \\nMore than 200,000 gallons of oil a day are spewing from the blown-out well at the site of BP 's Deepwater Horizon rig , which exploded April 20 and sank two days later . \\nCrews are using at least six remotely operated vehicles to try to shut off an underwater valve , but so far they 've been unsuccessful . \\nMeanwhile , high winds and waves are pushing oily water over the booms meant to contain it . \\nBesides BP , a slew of federal and state agencies are scrambling to minimize the onslaught of damage . \\nExperts in oil spills have drills every few years to practice their response for spills of `` national significance . '' \\nOne of those practice runs took place just last month in Maine . \\nThe Gulf of Mexico leak is a `` combination of all the bad things happening '' and makes it far worse than any disaster imagined in the drills , said Nancy Kinner , director of the Coastal Response Research Center at the University of New Hampshire . \\n`` This is relentless , '' Kinner said . \\nMost Americans think of Exxon Valdez when it comes to spills . \\nBut the potential and likelihood here `` is well beyond that , '' said University of Rhode Island ocean engineering professor Malcolm Spaulding . \\nBecause the Deepwater Horizon well has not been capped and may flow for months more , it should be compared to a bigger more dangerous one from a well explosion in 1979 , said Tunnell . \\nThat was Ixtoc 1 , off the coast of Mexico . \\nIt was the worst peacetime oil spill on record . \\nThe current spill `` is kind of a worst case scenario , '' Tunnell said . \\nWhat makes this spill relentless and most similar to Ixtoc 1 is that it 's an active well that keeps flowing . \\nThe Exxon Valdez was a tanker with a limited supply of oil . \\nThe rig 40 miles from the Gulf Coast may leak for months before a relief well can be drilled to stop the flow , Kinner said . \\nAnd LSU 's Overton said : `` I 'm not very optimistic that they 'll be drilling a relief well in three months . '' \\nThe type of oil involved is also a major problem . \\nWhile most of the oil drilled off Louisiana is a lighter crude , this is n't . \\nIt 's a heavier blend because it comes from deep under the ocean surface , Overton said . \\n`` If I had to pick a bad oil , I 'd put this right up there . \\nThe only thing that 's not bad about this is that it does n't have a lot of sulfur in it and the high sulfur really smells bad . '' \\nThe first analysis of oil spill samples showed it contains asphalt-like substances that make a major sticky mess , he said . \\nThis is because the oil is older than most oil in the region and is very dense . \\nThis oil also emulsifies well , Overton said . \\nEmulsification is when oil and water mix thoroughly together , like a shampoo , which is mostly water , said Penn State engineering professor Anil Kulkarni . \\nIt `` makes a thick gooey chocolate mousse type of mix , '' Kulkarni said . \\nAnd once it becomes that kind of mix , it no longer evaporates as quickly as regular oil , does n't rinse off as easily , ca n't be eaten by oil-munching microbes as easily , and does n't burn as well , experts said . \\nThat type of mixture essentially removes all the best oil clean-up weapons , Overton and others said . \\nUnder better circumstances , with calmer winds and water , the oil might have a chance of rising without immediately emulsifying , but that 's not happening here , Kulkarni said . \\nIt 's pretty much mixed by the time it gets to the surface . \\nThe wind and waves are also pushing the oil directly toward some of the most sensitive coastal areas : the marshlands of Louisiana and surrounding states . \\nAnd there are three types of beaches : sandy , rocky and marshy . \\nSandy beaches , like those in Florida , are the easiest to clean , Overton said . \\nBy far the hardest are marshlands and that 's where the oil is heading first . \\nMarshes are so delicate that just trying to clean them causes damage , Kinner said . \\nOnce the oily mess penetrates , grasses must be cut . \\nBut it also penetrates the soil and that is extremely difficult to get out , she said . \\nThe normal bacteria that eats oil needs oxygen to work , and in the soils of the marsh , there 's not enough oxygen for that process , she said . \\nIt 's also the time of year in the Gulf of Mexico when fish spawn , plankton bloom and the delicate ecosystem is at a vulnerable stage . \\nHurricane season is fast approaching in June and experts are sure the oil will still be flowing by then . \\nThough it might seem counterintuitive , a big storm could help by dispersing and diluting the worst of the oil , Overton said . \\n`` A hurricane is Mother Nature 's vacuum cleaner , '' Overton said . \\nNormally it cleans things up . \\nBut that 's not a solution with a continuing spill .

Geithner on Tuesday to discuss the spill , the paper said . \\nThe amount of oil spurting from the well has been a matter of considerable controversy in the past two months , with critics saying BP consistently understated the flow rate . \\nThe internal BP document , which is undated , was released by U.S. Representative Ed Markey , chairman of a subcommittee of the House Energy and Commerce Committee . \\nThe document appears to estimate the highest potential flow of oil if key components of the well fail . \\nIt does not indicate that the 100,000 barrels per day is BP 's estimate of the actual amount gushing from the ruptured Gulf of Mexico well . \\n`` Right from the beginning , BP was either lying or grossly incompetent , '' Markey told NBC 's `` Meet the Press . '' \\n`` First they said it was only 1,000 barrels , then they said it was 5,000 barrels . '' \\nBut BP 's Odone said , `` I do n't think there 's been any underestimating . \\nWe 've always said we would deal with whatever volume of oil was being spilled and that 's exactly what we 're doing . '' \\nThe document was posted on the Internet here London 's Sunday Times , without citing any sources , said BP planned to raise $ 10 billion from a bond sale , $ 20 billion from banks and $ 20 billion from asset sales over the next two years to cover the cost of the spill . \\nBP said last week it would suspend dividend payments to its shareholders and increase the pace of asset sales to $ 10 billion this year to offset liabilities from the spill , which began after an explosion on an offshore rig that killed 11 workers . \\nThe Financial Times reported BP is considering doubling the $ 10 billion asset sale program as part of a push to strengthen the company 's liquidity as it comes under financial pressure . \\nBP said 21,040 barrels of oil -LRB- 883,680 gallons\\/3 .34 million liters -RRB- -RRB- leaking from the well was collected by its siphoning systems Saturday . \\nA large amount of oil continues to leak into the sea from the ruptured well a mile below the ocean surface despite the BP containment systems . \\nKenneth Feinberg , the independent administrator appointed to run the $ 20 billion fund set up by BP to compensate victims for financial losses due to the oil spill , said he would make sure that `` every eligible , legitimate claim is paid and paid quickly . '' \\nAppearing on NBC 's `` Meet the Press , '' Feinberg rejected the complaint of a senior Republican congressman , Joe Barton , who said last week that the fund set up by BP under pressure from President Barack Obama amounted to a government `` shakedown . '' \\n`` I do n't think it helps to politicize this program , '' said Feinberg , an arbitration lawyer who dispensed hundreds of millions of dollars to victims of the September 11 , 2001 attacks . \\n`` This a voluntary program . \\nNo one is compelled to come into this fund . '' \\nDespite assurances of swift compensation , Louisiana Gulf residents remained skeptical . \\n`` Every time they say there 's a fund for fisherman , we wait years and years , '' said Tal Plork , whose fisherman husband , Phan , faced long waits for aid after two hurricanes rampaged across the Gulf region in 2008 . \\n`` It was like that for Gustav and Ike . \\nHopefully now they will go faster . '' \\nPlork , 42 , has had to go to work since the oil leak began because her husband 's fishing income has dried up . \\nShe works at a cafeteria at the BP camp in Venice , Louisiana , and has been supporting her five children mainly on credit cards . \\nMississippi Governor Haley Barbour , also appearing on `` Meet the Press , '' said he was anxious to see the well capped , the spill cleaned up and BP cover the entire cost . \\n`` Nothing is satisfactory until the well is shut in . \\nWhen the well is capped , then clean up the oil , and then BP pays the bills . \\nUntil all of that is done , nothing is satisfactory , '' said Barbour , a Republican . \\nBarbour said he thought the U.S. federal government `` has done more right than wrong '' in its handling of the disaster . \\nAfter falling 6.8 percent last week , BP 's shares are down 26 percent so far in June , their worst month since the October 1987 market crash . \\nDespite the battering to its reputation and stock stemming from the disaster , hedge fund T2 Partners said it likes shares in the British oil firm , according to a Barron 's article published Sunday . \\nIn a column titled `` Other Voices , '' T2 's managing partners said their reasons for recently taking a new position in BP are that it is `` extraordinarily cheap , '' and that the firm is `` highly likely '' to be able to cover clean-up , damages , fines and lawsuits relating to the disaster . \\nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \\nNobody thought it was insensitive of Obama to vacation in an $ 8m house after his inauguration , when so many people lived in their car because of the great recession . \\nI 'm sure , the people in Iraq and Afghanistan would also like to get their life back after the US invasions for no more real purpose than : oil . \\n20 Billion $ for the oil clean up ? \\nIt 's for the U.S. Government to embezzle . \\nVery little of that money will make it to the Gulf victims . \\nDo you know who is going to pay for the oil clean up ? \\nYep , We will probably pay a couple of bucks per a gallon more at the pump in a year or two . \\nMost of that 20 billion dollars will end up in some off shore bank and then in the pockets of who knows who ?????????

'' \\nMorgan City , a small town dependent on both shrimping and the oil trade , lies about 70 miles west of New Orleans and is still untouched by the BP oil slick . \\nBut you 'd have thought that the disaster , which threatens the very survival of Louisiana 's seafood industry , would have made Morgan City feel a little uneasy about celebrating `` the unique way in which these two seemingly different industries work hand-in-hand culturally and environmentally in this area of the ` Cajun Coast ' , '' but it does n't seem to have . \\nI 've been staying for a few days with my old friend Julia Reed and her husband John in their magnificent , Greek-revival house in the Garden District of New Orleans , a leafy neighborhood of Victorian merchant palaces far removed from the noise and congestion of the picturesque French Quarter . \\nThey had just bought and renovated their house when they precipitately had to abandon it to Hurricane Katrina , which it mercifully survived almost intact . \\nIt was in Julia 's book about the experience that I learned of the existence of the Shrimp and Petroleum Festival , an heroic but doomed attempt by Louisianians to persuade themselves that the two main sources of their livelihood are compatible . \\nThe importance they attach to both industries explains the fact that there is almost as much anger with President Obama for ordering a moratorium on deepwater oil-drilling , thus threatening the survival of the Louisiana oil industry , as there is with BP for polluting its fishing grounds and oyster beds . \\nA visitor to New Orleans at the moment would n't realize at first that anything was amiss . \\nThe oil that is washing up elsewhere on the state 's shores does n't yet encroach on its main city , which , having finally emerged from the Katrina nightmare , is full of life and bustle . \\nBut you soon sense the anxiety and anger that people are feeling the `` small people '' , as the chairman of BP misguidedly called them this week . \\nThey are not only fearful for their futures ; they feel overlooked and neglected by Washington . \\nNew Orleanians are convinced that elsewhere in America such a disaster would not have been allowed to happen ; or that if it did happen , in , say , New York or California , urgent and decisive action would have been taken by the federal government to mitigate its effects . \\nPresident Bush 's botched response to Hurricane Katrina , and a belief that the Mississippi would never in any case have broken its banks if the levees had been properly maintained , has left New Orleanians drained of confidence in Washington and its ways . \\nDespite President Obama 's four visits to the area , his promise to restore the Gulf Coast to its former glory , and his widely lauded achievement in getting BP to put aside 20 billion dollars to cover compensation claims , an opinion poll yesterday found that most Louisianians think that Bush handled Katrina better than Obama is handling the oil disaster . \\nThe president must partly blame himself for this perception . \\nDespite being begged to take control of the clean-up away from the hated BP , he has looked too often like a helpless observer of events . \\nWhen he said he would fire Tony Hayward , the BP chief executive , if he were working for him , and that he was looking around to see `` whose ass to kick '' , he merely reinforced this impression . \\nCarl-Henric Svanberg 's insistence on Wednesday that he cared about `` small people '' is the latest in a series of gaffes by BP that have convinced Louisianians that the company is arrogant and heartless . \\n-LRB- `` We 're not small people , '' said one New Orleans resident , quoted in the Washington Post . \\n`` We 're human beings . \\nThey 're no greater than us . \\nWe do n't bow down to them .

'' \\nKarzai has also been pushing for reconciliation with the Taliban and for the first time in the 10-year war , Pakistan , Afghanistan and the United States all share - in theory at least -- a commitment to seek a political settlement . \\nBut deep distrust remains , both between the United States and Pakistan and between Afghanistan and Pakistan . \\nPakistan has so far been excluded from Washington 's early contacts with the Taliban , Grossman told a news conference in Kabul . \\n`` Up to now , the government of Pakistan has not been involved in that particular process at all , as yet . '' \\nKabul accuses Pakistan of continuing to support the Afghan Taliban , whom it openly backed when they were in power from 1996 to 2001 , to maintain its influence in Afghanistan . \\nIt also says Islamabad is trying to manipulate peace talks to its advantage , to the point of sabotaging them if they do not go in the direction it wants . \\n`` We expect practical steps from Pakistan in the weeks and months ahead to help sustain the peace process , '' a senior Afghan government official said . \\n`` The ball is in Pakistan 's court . '' \\nMujhda , the political analyst , echoed widespread distrust in Kabul of Pakistan 's intentions . \\n`` In each of these meetings the reconciliation issue is raised , promises are made and then the countries go home and nothing is done , '' he said . \\n`` Pakistan has so far opposed attempts by the U.S. to talk to the Taliban . '' \\nThe United States is also reluctant to include all insurgents in a political settlement , limiting its talks to the Afghan Taliban led by Mullah Mohammed Omar , but excluding the Haqqani network - the most active group in eastern Afghanistan . \\nIt is pushing Pakistan to expand its military operations in its tribal areas to target militants who use them as a base to fight in Afghanistan . \\nPakistan says its overstretched military will give priority to fighting militants who are killing its own people . \\nWith the Taliban talks still at a preliminary stage , and vulnerable to ethnic and regional rivalries which could plunge Afghanistan deeper into civil war as U.S. troops withdraw , the cross-border shelling has added another complication to a fragile situation . \\nThe Afghan government said on Sunday that `` it strongly condemned the firing of 470 rockets over the past three weeks from the Pakistan side of the border in the eastern provinces of Kunar and Nangahar provinces . '' \\nPresident Hamid Karzai expressed his deep concern , it said , and asked Pakistan to immediately stop firing into Afghanistan . \\nA spokesman for Karzai said on Monday Pakistan 's ambassador to Kabul had been summoned over the issue , though adding : `` we are sure it can be resolved . '' \\nPakistan army spokesman Major-General Athar Abbas said no rounds had been intentionally fired into Afghanistan . \\nIn the last month , there had been five major attacks from the Afghan side of the border , in which 55 men in the Pakistani security forces had been killed and 80 wounded . \\n`` The fleeing militants were engaged by the security forces and a few accidental rounds going across can not be ruled out , '' he said . \\nPakistan says militants , including Pakistani Taliban commanders , have taken refuge on the Afghan side after it launched military operations to drive them out of its Federally Administered Tribal Areas . \\nIt was angered by a U.S. decision to thin out its troops in eastern Afghanistan , including the Korengal valley in Kunar province , when Washington decided to concentrate on population centres in southern Afghanistan , the Taliban heartland . \\n`` For quite some time we have been highlighting that there are safe havens across the border , '' Abbas said . \\n`` Something should be done about these . '' \\nBefore the killing of bin Laden , the United States had been talking about improving coordination of military operations on both sides of the border so that they could work with , rather than against , each other , in fighting insurgents . \\nThat cooperation may have deteriorated in the breakdown of trust which followed the unilateral U.S. raid to get bin Laden , perhaps explaining the escalation in cross-border shelling . \\nIt is impossible to verify independently exactly what is happening on the remote mountainous border .

Thad Allen , the government 's point man on the crisis . \\nThat would mean the cap is capturing better than half of the oil , based on the government 's estimate that around 600,000 gallons -LRB- 2.25 million liters -RRB- to 1.2 million gallons -LRB- 4.5 million liters -RRB- a day are leaking from the bottom of the sea . \\nThe undersea efforts came as BP Chief Operating Officer Doug Suttles struck an upbeat tone about the anticipated progress of the oil containment , saying that the spill `` should be down to a relative trickle by Monday or Tuesday . '' \\nSuttles told The Associated Press in a stop in Alabama that the arrival of a second vessel in the coming days to help pump the oil from the deepwater gusher will allow engineers to make significant progress , even as others involved in the disaster were much less optimistic and continued to criticize BP over its litany of failures to control the spill . \\nA team of researchers and government officials assembled by the Coast Guard and run by the director of the U.S. Geological Survey is studying the flow rate and hopes to present its latest findings in the coming days on what is already the biggest oil spill in U.S. history . \\nIn an interview with The Associated Press , team member and Purdue University engineering professor Steve Wereley said it was a `` reasonable conclusion '' but not the team 's final one to say that the daily flow rate is , in fact , somewhere between 798,000 gallons -LRB- 3 million liters -RRB- and 1.8 million gallons -LRB- 6.8 million liters -RRB- . \\n`` BP is claiming they 're capturing the majority of the flow , which I think is going to be proven wrong in short order , '' Wereley said . \\n`` Why do n't they show the American public the before-and-after shots ? '' \\nHe added : `` It 's strictly an estimation , and they are portraying it as fact . '' \\nTo install the device snugly , BP engineers had to cut away the twisted and broken well pipe . \\nThat increased the flow of oil , similar to what happens when a kink is removed from a garden hose . \\nBP and others warned that would happen . \\nThe government said the increase amounted to about 20 percent . \\nAsked about the containment effort and the uncertainties in estimating how much oil is escaping , Allen said : `` I have never said this is going well . \\nWe 're throwing everything we 've got . '' \\nPaul Bommer , a University of Texas petroleum and geosystems engineering professor and member of the flow rate team , said cap seems to have made a `` dent '' in reducing the flow , but there is still a lot of oil coming out . \\nThat seemed clear from the underwater `` spillcam '' video , which continued to show a big plume of gas and oil billowing into the water . \\nThe current equipment collecting the oil being brought to the surface is believed to be nearing its daily processing capacity . \\nBP said it will boost capacity by bringing in a floating platform it believes can process most of the flow , and believes the extra pumping power can help reduce the spill by early next week , when President Barack Obama is scheduled to make his fourth visit to the Gulf since the disaster began . \\nThe company also said it will use a device that vaporizes and burns off oil while working to design a new cap that can capture more crude . \\nAt the same time , BP is working to design a new cap that can capture more oil . \\nIn the seven weeks since the oil rig explosion that set off the catastrophe , BP has had to improvise at every turn . \\nThe most recent government estimates put the total amount of oil lost at 23.7 million to 51.5 million gallons . \\n`` I think virtually everybody from BP to the state to the Coast Guard was caught flat-footed and did not expect a spill of this magnitude , '' said Ed Overton , a professor of environmental sciences at Louisiana State University . \\n`` Everybody has been playing catch-up . '' \\nWhen asked why BP did not have containment systems on standby in case of a leak , BP spokesman Robert Wine said there was no reason to think an accident on this scale was likely . \\n`` It 's unprecedented , '' he said . \\n`` That 's why these caps were n't there before . '' \\nKenneth Arnold , an offshore drilling consultant and engineer , said the reason a bigger cap was n't installed first was that BP probably wanted to start with what it could do quickly , which he said makes sense . \\nHe said BP has been working several solutions all along in parallel and deploying them as they can . \\n`` They have n't been waiting for one to fail and then employing the next one , '' Arnold said . \\nHe added : `` The idea you can wave your arm at this and come to a magical solution is just from someone who does n't understand the problem . \\nWe as a nation are used to instant gratification . \\nThere is a problem . \\nWe want someone to fix it tomorrow . \\nThings are not always that easy . '' \\nSome answers may emerge next week , when BP CEO Tony Hayward will make his first appearance before Congress to answer questions in what will probably be a heated session , given the anger directed at BP . \\nThe debate over the flow rate came as workers in bulldozers piled sand 6 feet -LRB- 1.83 meters -RRB- high along barrier islands bordering Louisiana to protect the environmentally fragile areas from the spill , which has already coated islands and pelican rookeries in thick , brown , sticky crude . \\n`` This is finally something that can help , '' fishing guide Dave Marino said of the sand barrier effort . \\n`` It looks like this is something that may work . '' \\nAttempts to skim the oil progressed as well . \\nBoats fanned out across the Gulf , dragging boom in their wake in an attempt to corral the oil . \\nBut it 's an enormous task . \\nIn some spots , the oil is several inches thick -LRB- centimeters -RRB- and forms a brown taffy-like goo that sticks to everything it touches . \\nJohn Young , chairman of Louisiana 's Jefferson Parish Council , said additional equipment has been ordered and more dredgers will be moving into the area soon , along with barges that will help block the passes . \\n`` It 's nice that BP has put up the money , but they need to ramp up not only the manpower but the equipment out there because we 're losing the battle , '' Young said . \\n`` Unfortunately , we 're on day 50 and it 's too little too late , but I guess it 's better late than never . '' \\nMeanwhile , researchers are beginning to obtain a clearer picture of the spill as they analyze water samples . \\nFor example , marine scientists found a 100-foot -LRB- 30-meter -RRB- - thick layer of oil 1,300 feet -LRB- 390 meters -RRB- below the surface about 45 miles -LRB- 72 kilometers -RRB- from the well site . \\nAnd officials in the Florida Panhandle are posting signs warning beachgoers not to swim or fish off a six-mile -LRB- 10-kilometer -RRB- stretch of oil-fouled beaches near the Alabama state line -- the first time such restrictions have been imposed in the state since the spill began .

'' \\nThree or four large plumes have been found , at least one that is 10 miles long and a mile wide , said Samantha Joye , a marine science professor supporting the mission from her University of Georgia lab . \\nThese researchers were also testing the effects of large amounts of subsea oil on oxygen levels in the water . \\nThe oil can deplete oxygen in the water , harming plankton and other tiny creatures that serve as food for a wide variety of sea critters . \\nOxygen levels in some areas have dropped 30 percent , and should continue to drop , Joye said . \\n`` It could take years , possibly decades , for the system to recover from an infusion of this quantity of oil and gas , '' Joye said . \\n`` We 've never seen anything like this before . \\nIt 's impossible to fathom the impact . '' \\nJoye 's lab was waiting for the research boat to return so a team of scientists can test about 75 water samples and 100 sediment samples gathered during the voyage . \\nResearchers plan to go back out in about a month and sample the same areas to see if oil and oxygen levels have worsened . \\nFederal regulators on Friday approved the underwater use of the chemicals , which act like a detergent to break the oil into small globules and allow it to disperse more quickly into the water or air before it comes ashore . \\nThe decision by the Environmental Protection Agency angered state officials and fishermen , who complained that regulators ignored their concerns about the effects on the environment and fish . \\n`` The EPA is conducting a giant experiment with our most productive fisheries by approving the use of these powerful chemicals on a massive , unprecedented scale , '' John Williams , executive director of the Southern Shrimp Alliance , said in a news release . \\nLouisiana Health and Hospitals Secretary Alan Levine sent a letter to BP outlining similar concerns , but the company and the Coast Guard said several tests were done before approval was given . \\n`` We did n't cross this threshold lightly , '' Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said . \\n`` This is a tool that will be analyzed and monitored . '' \\nAs crews worked to limit the environmental hazards , Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano pressured BP to make clear whether the company would limit how much it will pay for clean up and compensation to those hurt by the spill . \\nIn a letter to chief executive Tony Hayward , she noted that he and other executives have said they are taking full responsibility for cleaning up the spill and will pay what they call `` legitimate '' claims . \\nNapolitano said the government believes this means BP will not limit its payments to a $ 75 million cap set by law for liability in some cases . \\n`` The public has a right to a clear understanding of BP 's commitment to redress all of the damage that has occurred or that will occur in the future as a result of the oil spill , '' Napolitano wrote . \\nOn Friday , President Barack Obama assailed oil drillers and his own administration as he ordered extra scrutiny of drilling permits . \\nHe condemned the shifting of blame by oil executives and denounced a `` cozy relationship '' between the companies and the federal government .

' \\nelement - after you have read it , something you have always vaguely thought becomes crystal clear '' . \\nHe sought rights from Klein via her website and was sent a standard response email about the essay which said that the rights were controlled by Harper 's , the original publishers of the article . \\nThe magazine agreed to sub-licence the article . \\nRynja says that all was running smoothly until about three weeks before the publication date when he had two long conversations with Klein about the book . \\n`` I heard that she is working on a new book on the subject and did n't want the essay published on its own , '' he says . \\n`` She felt passionately that the book should be turned into an anthology with more authors included . \\nWe could have gone ahead and published the essay on its own , as planned , if we had wanted as we had the rights , but because she felt very strongly and I admire her as a great thinker and writer - in the calibre of Noam Chomsky or Hannah Arendt - I did what I could and we missed the original publication date in order to include three other extremely strong authors who develop the seam of the lead article further . '' \\nThe three other contributors are Susan Watkins , writing on the Iraq war as a front for US commercial , interests , Brian Miller on selling Iraq and Walter Lecoeur on terrorism . \\nAccording to Rynja , the reason the other contributors are not mentioned on any of the online information about the book is because the revised data submitted to Neilson Bookdata and Amazon has not yet been updated and the sites are still displaying information referring to the original version of the Klein-only book . \\nIn response to Klein 's claim that the writing in the book is not `` original '' , Ryjna argues that many books are published first in the US and then in the UK , or carried from one medium to another and that the work itself stays original . \\n`` There is a market for books in their physical form rather than in electronic form , '' he says , `` it 's simply bringing her very important message to different markets . '' \\nHowever , the situation may be murkier than it first appears . \\nWhile it is true that Harper 's had syndication rights on Klein 's essay , the author retained the book contract rights and the sale of them to Ryjna by Harper 's was a mistake - one about which Klein says she knew nothing until three weeks before the book was due to be published . \\nAt this point , having failed to persuade Ryjna to withdraw the book , Klein and her agent tried to salvage the situation as best they could , and avoid a protracted legal battle , by mooting the possibility of an anthology in which all the contributors would be equally credited . \\nAgain , however , Gibson Square have a different take on events : they reiterate that they did approach Klein , via her website , to ask for the rights to publish the essay in book form in the UK and were told to approach the magazine , from whom the rights were obtained . \\nThey then claim they went back to Klein in the first week of March to ask for corrections or additions , at which point the idea to include three other writers came up , and was agreed to . \\nPolitico 's , the specialist political online bookstore , is advertising No War as being `` by Naomi Klein '' on its website , and reports no complaints about it from customers but they have not yet sold a single copy of the book . \\n`` I was not aware of Naomi Klein 's statement but I will look into it , '' said a spokesman for Politicos , `` If the book is being mis-sold we will take it off the site . '' \\nWaterstone 's Economist 's Bookshop at the LSE said that they had sold three copies of the book , from a stock of about 25 , and had received no complaints from customers . \\nThe book is officially published on April 18 and , says Rynja , Gibson Square 's wholesalers have already sold nearly a thousand copies of the book . \\nMeanwhile , Naomi Klein is encouraging readers interested in her essay , Baghdad Year Zero , to download it for free from her website , nologo.org .

'' \\nOne problem is that Gaddafi 's remaining loyalists are in Bani Walid and Sirte , which are densely populated . \\nThat makes it risky to try to bomb them because of the danger of civilian casualties . \\nNATO , argues Shashank Joshi , an analyst with the Royal United Services Institute in London , lacks sufficient intelligence to allow it to pinpoint targets in Sirte and Bani Walid without endangering civilians . \\n`` We are in a fortress situation where the city is under siege . \\nIf you do n't know that a particular building is being used as a school or a mosque , even the best intelligence wo n't give you the details , '' he said . \\n`` In Tripoli , you had rebels , you had -LRB- Western -RRB- special forces , networks of resistance . \\nWe do n't have that kind of information in Sirte or Bani Walid . \\nSo targeting is inherently difficult . '' \\nTo a degree , battle conditions with Gaddafi 's remaining loyalists necessitate a change of operational approach because of the limitations of NATO jets ' firepower which is to dangerous to use , said Ripley of Jane 's Defense Weekly . \\n`` Gaddafi forces are no longer using tanks and artillery that were easier to hit and identify . \\nThe NTC is using infantry to drive Gaddafi 's forces from building to building , '' Ripley said . \\n`` Both sides are operating in such close proximity that differentiating between the sides is difficult . \\nThat makes it very difficult to use air-drop weapons -LRB- bombs -RRB- . '' \\nExperts say other constraints also complicate NATO 's operations in Sirte and Bani Walid as its military commanders plan how to fulfill the alliance 's United Nations mandate in Libya to protect civilians during the civil war . \\nSo far , NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen has said , there are no confirmed cases of civilians being killed by NATO power , although alliance officials say some can not be ruled out . \\nHuman rights organizations have called on the alliance to lean on NTC fighters to do more to protect civilians as worries mount for people trapped in Sirte . \\nDesperation is growing in the besieged city as civilians try to flee the battle , both sides are accusing each other of endangering civilians , and aid agencies say a humanitarian disaster is looming because of shrinking supplies of water , electricity and food . \\n`` NATO has significant influence over the actions of -LRB- NTC -RRB- forces , '' said Peter Bouckaert of Human Rights Watch . \\n`` And needs to use it to ensure that the NTC meet their legal obligation under international law -LRB- to avoid civilian casualties -RRB- , '' he said . \\nAnother challenge for NATO , Bouckaert added , was preventing NTC forces from taking action against civilians they suspect of siding with Gaddafi loyalists . \\n`` It is essential that those civilian populations , even if they are pro-Gaddafi , do not suffer from vengeance , '' he said . \\nNATO officials acknowledge difficulties they are facing in Gaddafi 's last strongholds but have given little indication of how much firepower the deposed leader has at his disposal , other than `` small logistical and mobility capabilities '' . \\n`` Their actions are limited to tactical initiatives in isolated pockets , representing a fraction of Libya 's territory and population , '' said NATO spokesman Colonel Roland Lavoie . \\n`` They do n't control many access routes within Libya . \\nThe mission is not yet over but the end is near , '' Focusing on Gaddafi loyalists ' access routes to supplies or way out of their strongholds might be an important part of NATO tactics in the near future , military experts said . \\n`` A very big role NATO can play is to dominate the terrain , the roads outside of town , '' said Ripley . \\n`` They can enforce the siege but they can not finish off Gaddafi forces . \\nThey can prevent them from rebuilding , replenishing or escaping .

'' \\nBut Turkey 's policy shift , which has aligned Ankara more closely with the West , comes with risks . \\n`` Syrian intelligence might use every opportunity to instigate Kurdish violence , '' Aktar said , referring to Turkey 's restive minority population . \\nAktar said Turkey , whose clout in the Middle East has grown out of a combination of economic growth and secular democracy , could see goodwill evaporate if it is perceived to be meddling in Syria . \\n`` At the end of the day , Turkey risks being told to mind its own business and to first put its house in order . \\nThe more it wants to be a soft power the more it is going to be told by the international community to apply the same standards with its Kurds minority . '' \\nFor all their closeness over the past decade , the two countries almost went to war in the late 1990s over Syria giving refuge to Kurdish militants fighting the Turkish state . \\nLiving under Turkish protection , Syrian Colonel Riad al-As ` aad exhorts his former comrades to desert to organize the armed struggle he believes is needed to drive Assad from power . \\n`` We assure them -LRB- the Syrian people -RRB- they should be patient , and God willing , very soon , Bashar will be between their hands , '' As ` aad told Reuters in an interview on Thursday . \\n-LRB- nL5E7L642X -RRB- `` We must be patient . \\nWe hope the Syrian people will be stronger and remain committed to continue to bring down the regime . '' \\nRevolted by the killing of Syrian civilians , and seeing the tide of history turn with the `` Arab Spring '' of popular uprisings , Turkey has calculated that its long term interest lies in supporting the Syrian people 's struggle for democracy . \\nThat Syria , like Turkey , has a Sunni Muslim majority , while Assad and his clique belong to the Alawite minority , an offshoot of Shi'ite Islam , made that choice even simpler . \\nThe breakdown in their relationship leaves Iran as Syria 's closest backer , though the Russian and Chinese vetoes earlier this week of a U.N. Security Council draft resolution censuring Syria showed Assad retains some support elsewhere . \\nAnti-Assad factions meeting in Istanbul -- ranging from Islamists through liberals , along with ethnic and tribal leaders -- have coalesced under a revolutionary Syrian National Council with a stated aim of ousting Assad within six months . \\nOffering itself as a potential future interim government , this broad-based opposition group has helped instill some confidence among governments , like Turkey , who disapprove of Assad but had not known who to support . \\nHitherto , they have feared Assad 's fall would leave Syria without a central authority capable of stopping the country sliding into religious , sectarian and ethnic violence . \\nOne Western diplomat , asked about Turkey 's hesitation in the past to ditch Assad , said Ankara had come to see Assad as `` the devil we know . '' \\nTurkish Prime Minister Tayyip Erdogan , who had previously enjoyed a close rapport with Assad , is expected to visit a camp in the border province of Hatay sheltering some of the 7,500 Syrians who have fled the violence at home . \\nDue to the death of his mother , Erdogan delayed a visit that had been set for Sunday , but he has already promised to announce sanctions against the Syrian government . \\nTurkey is expected to freeze bank accounts held by members of Assad 's inner circle , cut ties with Syrian state banks , and halt deals between state-run companies , notably in oil and gas , while avoiding measures that could hurt the people . \\nErdogan predicted last month that Assad will be ousted `` sooner or later , '' but how far he is willing to go to make it happen is an open question . \\n`` What we have at the moment ... is a war of words between Assad and Erdogan , '' said Gareth Jenkins , an Istanbul-based security analyst . \\n`` It 's a bit like two jilted lovers , because they were very , very close . \\nThere is a lot of personal spite . '' \\nCompounding tensions this week , Turkey began military exercises in Hatay province , which Syria has had longstanding claims over since it was ceded to Turkey in 1939 when France controlled Syria and Lebanon . \\nThe exercises , relatively small-scale logistical drills involving a large contingent of less experienced reservist troops , are seen as a symbolic reminder to Damascus that the second largest army in NATO is just across the border . \\n`` It is part of the Turkish government 's campaign to apply increased psychological pressure on the regime in Damascus because previous warnings have gone unheeded , '' said Fadi Hakura , analyst at Chatham House think-tank in London . \\nTurkey has begun intercepting arms bound for Syria passing through its waters and air space . \\nSome analysts say it is easy to foresee Turkey eventually helping to equip and organize Syrian rebels , like Colonel As ` aad , who want to wage an armed struggle against those units of Assad 's security forces leading the repression of protesters . \\nOther analysts believe it would be a mistake for Turkey to go beyond support for peaceful protests by letting itself become a rear base for an armed opposition or being seen as a provocateur in Syria 's internal conflict , especially if it developed a stronger sectarian dimension . \\nTurkey , after all , is vulnerable to mischief-making among ethnic Kurds and developments that could cause unease within its own Alevi minority community . \\nSpeculation keeps resurfacing that Turkey 's military could end up entering Syria to create a buffer zone for the protection of Syrians from Assad 's security forces . \\nDuring the 1991 Gulf War , about half a million Iraqi Kurds fled to Turkey , returning only after Western powers , along with Turkish contingents , set up a safe haven across the border . \\nBut analysts see this option still as a last resort for Ankara , and one that is unlikely to be taken without first getting a U.N. mandate . \\nAs it has done in other Arab countries gripped by upheaval , Turkey has played on sentimental attachments to the Ottoman era , when Istanbul counted vast swathes of Arabia , North Africa and the Balkans among its dominions . \\nWhereas Erdogan has earned admiration among Arabs for championing the Palestinian cause and leading democratic change in Turkey , analysts say Arabs would not like to see Turkish troops crossing into Syria . \\n`` I do n't think Turkey ... would be stupid enough to intervene militarily , '' Jenkins said . \\n`` The Arab world does n't want to see Turkish boots on the ground in an Arab country .

' \\nDawn Halfaker was arguably more fortunate than Huff . \\nThe 25-year-old Californian is home from Iraq now and has been spending time before attending post-graduate college snowboarding and playing basketball - with one arm . \\nShe had already been in firefights and had killed insurgents when she went on a routine reconnaissance patrol with her military police platoon in Baquoba one night last year . \\nThey were ambushed and a rocket-propelled grenade screamed into her armored vehicle . \\nIt tore off the arm of Sergeant Norberto Lara , sending the limb flying into the driver 's lap , then exploded at Halfaker 's shoulder , blasting her head and arm . \\nMedics kept her alive until they reached a base , where her last words before passing out were : ` You bastards better not cut my arm off . ' \\nShe woke up an amputee , dreams of becoming a professional basketball player as shattered as her body . \\nBut she has no regrets about being a soldier in a modern war zone . \\n` Woman in combat is not really an issue . \\nIt is happening , ' she said . \\nFighting insurgents across Iraq makes for a chaotic battlefield . \\n` Everyone pretty much acknowledges there are no rear battle areas , no forward line of troops , ' said Halfaker . \\nFour women died under enemy fire in the Gulf war , where female troops made headlines flying combat aircraft , driving supply trucks close to the front lines and being taken as prisoners of war . \\nEight servicewomen died during the Vietnam war - all nurses - and hundreds have died in previous conflicts , but as auxiliary troops or medics serving far to the rear , succumbing most often to disease and accidents . \\nIn 1994 Bill Clinton opened up 90 per cent of military jobs to women . \\nBut although that meant they could officially go into combat by air and by sea , they were and still are barred from units that go on the offensive on land , including the general infantry , the marines and the special forces , and from units that accompany those troops . \\nArmy documents have now surfaced , however , recommending a lifting of the ban on women in units serving alongside other units that primarily go into combat . \\nOfficials say it is no more than a discussion document at this stage , others say it is the first step towards sanctioning women in land combat . \\n` The government will probably not deal with this until the Iraq conflict is over , otherwise , if it went the wrong way , they could face having to pull the women out of Iraq who are there now , who are de facto in combat , ' said Lory Manning , a retired navy captain and director of the Centre For Women in Uniform in Washington DC . \\nWomen are firing missiles from helicopters , but are not yet going on the offensive on the ground in Iraq , Manning said . \\nBut they are returning fire in ways never seen before . \\nParatrooper Kellie McCoy of St Louis , Missouri , has just returned to Iraq after a break following her award of a bronze star with a rare ` V ' for valor . \\nMcCoy , 29 , was only on her third day in Iraq last September when her convoy ran into an ambush during the attack on Falluja . \\nShe cranked out machine-gun rounds until she had killed enough of the enemy to break through and escape , rescuing others on the way . \\n` Captain McCoy willingly and repeatedly took action to gather up her soldiers under enemy fire and direct fire at the enemy , ' her citation stated . \\n` Her actions inspired her men to accomplish the mission and saved the lives of her fellow soldiers .

"HOUSTON\\/WASHINGTON | Tue Jun 8 , 2010 7:33 pm EDT HOUSTON\\/WASHINGTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Energy giant BP Plc said on Tuesday it was capturing more oil from its ruptured Gulf of Mexico well while U.S. scientists tried to figure out just how much crude was still pouring out . \\nThe London-based company 's share price closed down 5 percent in London after U.S. President Barack Obama said he wanted to know `` whose ass to kick '' over the massive spill . \\nThe on-going disaster remains at the top of Obama 's crowded domestic agenda , a point underscored by his strong comments and Tuesday 's announcement that he will head back to the Gulf coast next week to inspect efforts to contain the spill . \\nObama will visit Mississippi , Alabama and Florida during a two-day trip beginning on Monday , the White House said . \\nThe spill began on April 20 when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded and sank , killing 11 workers and causing the worst environmental disaster in U.S. history . \\nEfforts to contain the mess forged ahead . \\nBP said on Tuesday it had collected 14,800 barrels of oil from the leaking well on Monday , 33 percent higher than the amount collected on Sunday and the highest capture rate since it installed a new system last week to contain the spill . \\nBP later said it collected 7,850 barrels of oil in the 12-hour stretch ended at noon CDT -LRB- 1700 GMT -RRB- on Tuesday . \\nThat brought the total collected since the cap was installed to 51,364 barrels . \\nHoping to calm rising passions , BP said it would donate revenues from the oil it is recovering to restore Gulf wildlife habitats . \\nThe company had already committed itself to cleaning up after the disaster . \\nThe political heat remains intense as the disaster spills over into energy policy in Washington . \\nThe Interior Department issued new safety and environmental requirements for companies that want to drill in shallow waters . \\nThey have until June 28 to show they have met the new requirements or face being shut down . \\nBP chief executive Tony Hayward was called to testify , for the first time , at a congressional hearing on June 17 that will focus on the company 's role in the rig explosion and subsequent spill . \\nBP said he would attend . \\nAnother congressional committee investigating the spill sent a letter to rig operator Transocean that questioned whether the company had enough people working on Deepwater Horizon at the time of the explosion . \\nAfter the spill , the Obama administration imposed a six-month moratorium on new drilling permits for exploration and development wells in waters deeper than 500 feet . \\nU.S. officials also refused to approve new drilling in shallow waters until new rules were issued . \\nCoast Guard Admiral Thad Allen , the top U.S. official overseeing the cleanup effort , said on Monday neither BP nor the government knew just how much oil was gushing out of the well . \\n`` That 's the big unknown right now , '' he said . \\nBP has given conservative estimates of the oil flow that have been ridiculed by scientists and U.S. lawmakers . \\nEven the government 's much higher estimates of 12,000-19 ,000 barrels a day seemed on the low side after Allen said the company planned to double its collection of oil from the well to 20,000 barrels every day -LRB- 840,000 gallons\\/3 .18 million liters -RRB- . \\nAllen said on Tuesday U.S. scientists would present revised estimates later this week or early next week . \\nThe panel of experts has said BP 's latest effort to contain the oil spill could actually increase the flow rate by up to 20 percent . \\nBP and government officials have said a definitive solution will not come until August when a relief well is drilled . \\nObama , who faces growing criticism that he has appeared detached from the economic and ecological catastrophe hitting four U.S. Gulf states , sharpened his criticism of BP in an interview with NBC 's `` Today '' show that aired on Tuesday . \\nObama said he was talking to experts to find out what had gone wrong `` so I know whose ass to kick '' over the spill , which has soiled 120 miles of U.S. coastline and threatens the Gulf Coast 's lucrative fishing industry . \\nFadel Gheit , an analyst at Oppenheimer and Co , said it was `` not a coincidence '' that BP 's shares were down after Obama 's comments increased pressure on the company to fix the mess . \\nIn New York , BP 's American depositary shares fell more than 5 percent , mirroring the losses in earlier London trading . \\nTransocean shares also tumbled in New York , trading to their lowest in 18 months , as the market worried about the company 's liability for the oil disaster . \\nBP shares have lost about a third of their value since the crisis erupted . \\nInvestors are worried about the size of the final bill for the spill , expected to be in the billions . \\nThe company has already spent more than $ 1 billion on cleaning up the slick , which has fouled wildlife refuges in Louisiana and barrier islands in Mississippi and Alabama and also sent tar balls ashore on beaches in Florida . \\nOne-third of the Gulf 's federal waters , or 78,000 square miles -LRB- 200,000 square km -RRB- , remains closed to fishing , and the toll of dead and injured birds and marine animals is climbing . \\nU.S. weather forecasters gave their first confirmation on Tuesday that some of the oil leaking from BP 's well has lingered beneath the surface rather than rising to the top . \\nUndersea oil depletes the water 's oxygen content and threatens marine life like mussels , clams , crabs , eels and shrimp . \\nIn Fort Jackson in southern Louisiana , the New Orleans Saints , winners of the National Football League 's Superbowl in February , held a rally to help lift the spirits of communities reeling from the spill . \\n`` I came out to support the Saints and to try and get my mind off the oil spill . \\nThis team has meant everything to the state of Louisiana , '' said local homemaker Laura Bartholomew . \\nHundreds of fans , many wearing black and gold jerseys , braved scorching temperatures to attend the rally . \\nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \\nWe ca n't expect anything else from them other than trying to maximize profits at all costs . \\nIt 's our government that has let us down . \\nLack of regulation and the cozy relationship with the oil industry and their money has lead us to this moment . \\nNow that the White House is being deluged with emails urging him to show something , he 's coming out acting tough . \\nToo little too late , my man . \\nYou have lost our trust and will need to earn it back . \\nPass comprehensive campaign reform . \\nWe vote for them and then they listen to the lobbyists and not us . \\nStop playing politics and start leading . \\nOr else the Republicans will be back in power with their insane `` we do n't need government '' bull crap . \\nWhy spend this much time coming up with solutions to produce the well ? \\nIf the cement job is holding and the 9-5\\/8 ? \\nseal assembly is\\/was working . . \\nwhy not

'' \\nThat call was made aboard the Deepwater oil rig at 21.45 on 20 April , but was fatally optimistic . \\nThe rig was plunged into darkness as all power was lost and a huge explosion hit the rig 10 seconds later . \\n`` One of the technicians -LRB- one of the technicians -RRB- is shutting it in now , '' Macondo said . \\nThe `` nightmare well '' , as it had been dubbed by some workers , had become a real world horror . \\nThe minute-by-minute timeline in the report released by BP today , along with the astonishing catalogue of errors and failures the report details , paints a vivid picture of both the terror of that night on the rig and the extraordinary lapses in safety . \\nThe catastrophe , which led to the spilling of five million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico , began some time before 19.55 local time , deep below the sea . \\nOil and gas started forcing its way into the well bore , breaching a cement barrier . \\nWithout naming the cement contractor , Halliburton , the BP investigators made their opinion clear : `` There were weaknesses in cement design and testing , quality assurance and risk assessment . '' \\nTwo further barriers , in the so-called `` shoe track '' at the base of the well , then failed as the intense pressure of the hydrocarbons came to bear on them . \\nNext came perhaps the most crucial mistake . \\nPressure readings were taken on the well to determine whether it was under control , but despite `` anomalies '' the test was considered `` good '' . \\nBP 's report accepts some of the responsibility but also blames the Transocean rig crew for reaching the `` incorrect view that the test was successful '' . \\nThat was at 19.55 , and all must have seemed well on the rig , but below their feet the storm was gathering . \\nThe report estimates that at 21.38 , hydrocarbons burst through the well and into the riser , the pipe leading up to the rig . \\nWithin three minutes , mud had shot up through the derrick on the rig , the first warning blast , and from here events unfolded at breakneck speed . \\nAs the mud spurted , a valve was closed diverting the flow to a device that separated mud from gas - another crucial mistake . \\nThis brought the full force of the blown well directly onto the rig , rather than venting it overboard . \\nAt 21.45 , as mud was `` raining down on the deck '' and the well pressure was trebling , the call was made to shut the well . \\nIn the following minutes , high pressure gas was discharging towards the deck , vibrating the huge rig . \\nThe sirens of one gas alarm after another went off , and the drill pipe pressure rose another fivefold . \\nBy 21.49 , just four minutes after the call to shut the well was made , the rig was plunged into darkness as all power was lost . \\nThe darkness of the Gulf night lasted just five seconds . \\nA huge explosion hit the rig followed by another one 10 seconds later . \\nThe fate of Deepwater , and the biggest offshore oil spill in history , was set . \\nThose four minutes contained another series of terrible failures . \\nThe bursting of gas and oil into the wellbore pushed up pressure readings 40 minutes earlier , but it was 40 minutes before any action was taken . \\nOnce again , the BP report blames the rig crew - Transocean . \\nNext was the decision to route the flow of the hydrocarbons onto the rig , to the mud gas separator . \\nWithout that decision , `` there may have been more time to respond , and the consequences of the accident may have been reduced '' says the BP report . \\nThe onslaught of hydrocarbons overwhelmed the separator and allowed them to burst into parts of the rig that were not designed to suppress electrical sparks , via the heating , ventilation and air-conditioning systems , with explosive consequences . \\nAt 21.52 , the Mayday call went out , as the rig crew tried to ensure the blowout preventer - the 450-tonne set of valves on the sea floor and the ultimate failsafe - was in operation . \\nAs they did , 115 people began to leave the rig by a nearby ship . \\nThe coastguard were at the rig by 23.22 . \\nEleven hours later the rig sank and oil began to pour into the gulf . \\nThe failure of the blowout preventer was the final , catastrophic lapse . \\nBP 's report found that the explosions and fire on the rig very likely disabled the `` emergency disconnect sequence '' , the primary emergency response that was supposed the seal the well . \\nAn automatic system , meant to kick in if power from the rig was lost , also failed , for the prosaic and appalling reason that the batteries in one control pod were flat and a crucial valve in the other was faulty . \\nTwo days later , the Macondo well delivered the final insult . \\nRobot submarines had made it to the seabed and operated the shear valve that was meant to seal the well . \\nTransocean 's response to BP 's report has been scathing : `` This is a self-serving report that attempts to conceal the critical factor that set the stage for the Macondo incident : BP 's fatally flawed well design . \\nIn both its design and construction , BP made a series of cost-saving decisions that increased risk in some cases , severely . '' \\nStephen Davis was on board Deepwater and told the Guardian in May about his memory of that night of chaos : the sensation of being flung five metres into a wall by a powerful explosion , the desperate , muddy scramble on a deck lit only by the reflections from a huge pillar of flame ; the look in men 's eyes before they jumped 18 metres -LRB- 60ft -RRB- into the water . \\n`` You could taste the fumes , that godawful taste in your mouth . \\nIt was hard to breathe . \\nThe oxygen was being sucked out of the living quarters . \\nThen all of a sudden just boom . \\nIt was the biggest explosion I ever heard in my life .

"BEIRUT | Sat Aug 27 , 2011 8:46 am EDT BEIRUT -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The overthrow of Muammar Gaddafi by Libyan rebels supported by NATO forces focuses international attention on the five months of unrest in Syria , which has shaken one of the most tightly controlled Arab states . \\nOpposition figures and activists fear the successful use of force to topple Gaddafi may encourage Syrians to follow Libya 's example . \\nSyria 's fate is far more uncertain than the fate of Libya 's Muammar Gaddafi . \\nUpheaval in Syria would affect its allies and enemies in the volatile Middle East , and a softening in rhetoric from Arab countries this week indicated they might still be prepared to support President Bashar al-Assad if he implements reform . \\nFollowing are some possible scenarios in Syria and the risks and opportunities they would present : The United Nations says 2,200 people have been killed in Assad 's crackdown on dissent since protests broke out in March . \\nSyria says over 500 soldiers and police have been killed by armed groups which it blames for the violence . \\nDespite growing international condemnation , Western sanctions , and escalating economic pressures from the unrest , Assad 's rule shows no sign of imminent collapse . \\nNor is there any indication that the protests across the country are about to stop , although the number of protesters appears to have fallen since Assad sent troops into several major cities earlier in August . \\nIf Assad can not crush the protests completely , he may be able to contain their impact , staying in power despite the major upheaval and economic disruption caused by the unrest and growing international isolation . \\nSTRIKING A DEAL WITH OPPOSITION Assad could reshuffle his ministers and bring in some opposition figures in a symbolic move that will not stop street demonstrations but may convince some that he is serious about reforms , including the promise of multi-party elections by February . \\nAfter an apparently coordinated wave of criticism from regional powers including Saudi Arabia , Egypt and Turkey earlier this month , Arab states have moderated their language in recent days , hinting at a possible easing of pressure on Assad . \\nMany opposition figures have dismissed Assad 's promise of political reform and said they can not talk to the authorities while the violence continues . \\nBut if the deadlock continues , some members of the fractured opposition may feel there is no alternative to negotiation , despite the chasm of mistrust between the two sides . \\nSo far no country has proposed carrying out in Syria the kind of intervention undertaken by NATO forces to help Libyan rebels topple Muammar Gaddafi . \\nBut the collapse of Gaddafi 's rule has encouraged some Syrian opposition figures and protesters to support international intervention in Syria , including the idea of a Turkish buffer zone in northern Syria . \\nNATO help us , '' read one

militant groups like Hezbollah , Hamas and Islamic Jihad . \\n`` Any negative or bad development will affect the whole region , '' Hezbollah Secretary-General Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah said on Friday .

'' \\nFor the Syrian Kurds , whom he describes as `` part of the largest single ethnic grouping in the region that lacks a state '' , there is `` an opportunity to create more autonomy and respect for Kurdish rights '' . \\n`` They have the motivation , opportunity , and their Kurdish allies in Iraq and Turkey to encourage them . \\nBut what will hold them back is Turkey 's determination to prevent a mini-statelet in Syria along with the Kurds own internal divisions , '' he says . \\nThe Kurdish factor in the Syrian crisis will prove to be as significant as the Kurdish question in Iraq '' End Quote Prof Fawaz Gerges London School of Economics `` It is unlikely , '' he believes , `` that Syria 's Kurds will be able to establish a separate entity in Syria . \\nNor will the United States , nor the international community accept that . '' \\n`` At the same time , the several dimensions of the Kurdish problem - the Iraqi Kurds ' growing determination to remain a separate entity ; Turkish determination to avoid another mini-Kurdistan along the Syrian-Iraqi border ; and the issue of the PKK , the armed Kurdish insurgents fighting the Turkish Army - will create a real flashpoint . '' \\nThere in a nutshell is the scale of the problem . \\nThe Kurds ' future in Syria will have an important bearing upon what sort of country it is going to become . \\nBut the fate of the Syrian Kurds also has ramifications well beyond the country 's borders . \\nThese processes are already under way . \\nFawaz Gerges , professor of Middle Eastern Politics at the London School of Economics , told me that `` the Syrian Kurds have already seized the moment and are laying the foundation for an autonomous region like their counterparts in Iraq '' . \\n`` The exit of Assad 's forces from the Kurdish areas has complicated the crisis and deepened Turkey 's fears that its borders with Iraq and Syria will be volatile for years to come , '' he says . \\nTurkey has accused Syria of encouraging rebels from the Kurdistan Worker Party -LRB- PKK -RRB- `` The Kurdish factor in the Syrian crisis will prove to be as significant as the Kurdish question in Iraq . '' \\nProf Ofra Bengio , head of the Kurdish Studies program at the Moshe Dayan Centre at Tel Aviv University , agrees . \\n`` The Kurdish dimension is likely to become a potent factor in the near future because of the weakening of each of the states in which they live , because co-operation among the states for curbing the Kurds is non-existent , and because the Kurds have made headway in the United States and in the West , where they proved their loyalty and lack of religious extremism . \\n`` In a word , the West might like to support them . '' \\nIf a Kurdish spectre is stalking the region then it is probably Turkey that has most reason to be worried . \\nEven as Ankara has watched developments in Syria with unease , its own struggle with guerrilla fighters of the Kurdish PKK -LRB- designated a terrorist organization by Turkey , the EU and the US -RRB- has flared up again . \\nTurkey 's Foreign Minister Ahmet Davotoglu has insisted that the Syrian government is encouraging the PKK , to get its own back for Turkey 's insistence that President Assad must go . \\nBut it is even more complicated than this . \\nThe dominant Kurdish faction inside Syria is a close ally - some say even an off-shoot - of the PKK . \\nIt has little love for the mainstream Syrian opposition championed by the Turks . \\nWhilst fighting the PKK on one front , Turkey is desperately trying to curb the political ambitions of Syria 's Kurds by political means . \\nIndeed the ramifications of the Kurdish issue go even further . \\nProf Gerges insists that the Kurdish question `` is here to stay '' . \\n`` It transcends national borders and has the potential to redraw the Sykes-Pico agreement , which , after the collapse of the Ottoman Empire in 1918 , established existing nation-state boundaries . \\nKurds in Syria have long complained of discrimination by the government `` Although it is too early to talk about the emergence of a greater Kurdistan , an imagined community of Kurds resonates deeply among Kurds across Turkey , Iraq , Syria and Iran . '' \\nIt is in this sense the upheavals associated with the `` Arab Spring '' take on their full regional significance . \\nThe Sykes-Picot Agreement -LRB- named not surprisingly after the two negotiators , Mr Georges Picot and Sir Mark Sykes -RRB- was a secret understanding made between France and Britain in 1916 for the dismemberment of the Ottoman Empire . \\nThe agreement led to the division of Turkish-held areas of the Levant into various French and British administered territories which eventually gave rise to the modern-day states of Syria , Lebanon , Iraq and ultimately Israel . \\nMany Syrian Kurds have fled to Iraqi Kurdistan to escape the violence Fawaz Gerges asserts that the events in Syria and their potential repercussions risk over-turning this familiar world ; a broader re-ordering of the region in which Kurdish aspirations are just one part of a very complex picture . \\n`` Many of the problems in the contemporary Middle East are traced to that colonial-era Sykes-Picot map , which established the state system in the region . \\nThe Palestine and Kurdish questions are cases in point . '' \\n`` National borders do not correspond to imagined communities . \\nAlthough the state system has established deep roots in the Middle East in the last nine decades , the current uprisings have starkly exposed the fragility of the colonial system imposed on the region . \\n`` My take is that the great powers , together with their local partners , will fight tooth and nail to prevent the redrawing of the borders of the state system in the Middle East . \\n`` For once the map is re-drawn , where would the limits be ? \\nThere would be a real danger of perpetual instability and conflict , '' he says . \\nThe Kurds of Syria , of course , are not in quite the same position as their brothers in Iraq and would find it much harder to break away . \\nIn the back of the president 's mind , there may be the thought that empowering the Kurds is a way of weakening the Sunni Arab majority '' End Quote Joshua Landis Syrian expert Noted Syria expert Joshua Landis of the University of Oklahoma says that while Syria 's Kurds are a compact minority they are not a majority even in the north eastern border area with Turkey - where they constitute some 30-40 % of the population . \\nThey have sometimes tense relations with local Sunni Arab tribes who see this as an integral part of Syrian territory , reinforced by the fact that this is an area rich in oil resources vital to the Syrian economy . \\nProf Landis argues that what is going on in the Kurdish north-east offers a useful pointer to President Assad 's `` Plan B '' should his control over key cities like Damascus and Aleppo crumble . \\nHe says that the `` embattled president withdrew government forces from the north-east because he could n't control it and wanted to focus on the most important battles in Aleppo and Damascus '' . \\n`` But in the back of the president 's mind , there may be the thought that empowering the Kurds is a way of weakening the Sunni Arab majority and underlining the risks of fragmentation should his government fall . \\nIt 's a strategy of playing upon divisions to sow chaos , '' he said . \\nThis way , says Prof Landis , `` the Syrian Army - which is rapidly becoming an Alawite militia , whilst still the strongest military force - may lose control over large swathes of the country , but will remain a vital factor in determining the political outcome in Syria '' . \\nIt is a bleak prospect . \\nProf Landis asserts that President Assad `` may lose Syria , but could still remain a player , and his Alawite minority will not be destroyed '' . \\n`` That 's the future of Syria , '' he says , with little enthusiasm . \\n`` It 's what Lebanon was and what Iraq became .

'' \\nAs crews struggled to contain the oil slick , Coast Guard officials said Tuesday they were considering setting fire to the contaminated water to burn off the crude . \\nPools of oil far offshore would be trapped in special containment booms and set aflame as soon as Wednesday . \\n`` If we do n't secure this well , this could be one of the most significant oil spills in U.S. history , '' Coast Guard Rear Adm. Mary Landry said . \\nA similar burn off the coast of Newfoundland in 1993 eliminated 50 to 99 percent of captured oil . \\nHowever , burning the oil also creates air pollution , and the effect on marine life is unclear . \\nEd Overton , a professor emeritus of environmental sciences at Louisiana State University who 's studying the oil spill , questioned whether burning would work . \\n`` It can be effective in calm water , not much wind , in a protected area , '' he said . \\n`` When you 're out in the middle of the ocean , with wave actions , and currents , pushing you around , it 's not easy . '' \\nHe has another concern : The oil samples from the spill he 's looked at shows it to be a sticky substance similar to roofing tar . \\n`` I 'm not super optimistic . \\nThis is tarry crude that lies down in the water , '' he said . \\n`` But it 's something that has got to be tried . '' \\nAccording to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration , birds and mammals are more likely to escape a burning area of the ocean than escape from an oil slick . \\nThe agency said birds might be disoriented by the plumes of smoke , but they would be at much greater risk from exposure to oil in the water . \\nIn Washington , meanwhile , the Obama administration launched a full investigation of the explosion , and Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano and Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said they will devote every available resource to the probe . \\nMeanwhile , the glistening sheen of sweet crude continued to grow and began forming long reddish-orange ribbons of oil that , if they wash up on shore , could cover birds , white sand beaches and marsh grasses . \\nThe last major spill in the Gulf was in June 1979 , when an offshore drilling rig in Mexican waters -- the Ixtoc I -- blew up , releasing 140 million gallons of oil . \\nIt took until March 1980 to cap the well , and a great deal of the oil contaminated U.S. waters and Texas shores . \\n`` In the worst-case scenario , this could also last months , '' said Richard Haut , a senior research scientist at the Houston Advanced Research Center who worked for Exxon for 20 years , 10 of them on an offshore platform in the North Sea . \\nOil from the Deepwater Horizon is not expected to reach the coast until late in the week , if at all . \\nAs of Tuesday , it was about 20 miles offshore , south of Venice , Louisiana . \\nThe spill covered an expanding area about 48 miles long and 80 miles wide , but with uneven borders , making it difficult to calculate its area in square miles . \\n`` I understand there 's got to be industry , but it 's so sad for our kids . \\nWe do n't have a lot of beaches left , '' Bonnie Bethel , 66 , said as she watched her grandchildren splash in the water on a Mississippi beach . \\n`` Can you imagine these poor birds in oil ? '' \\nThousands of birds such as egrets and brown pelicans are nesting on barrier islands close to the rig 's wreckage right now . \\nIf the oil gets to them , rescuers would need to reach their remote islands , wash them down and release them back into the wild . \\nMichael Ziccardi , director of the Oiled Wildlife Care Network affiliated with the University of California at Davis , said he is standing by to clean up Gulf Coast birds if they are hurt by the spill . \\nCleaning up brown pelican chicks after a modest spill in Louisiana in 2005 was a major undertaking , he said . \\n`` Just about any petroleum can cause problems for birds because they lose their waterproofing , and that 's what keeps them dry and warm , '' Ziccardi said . \\n`` It 's a really difficult time , and we 're close to the peak of migration . '' \\nThe spill also threatens billions of fish eggs and larvae coating the Gulf 's surface this time of year . \\nIf the well can not be closed , almost 100,000 barrels of oil , or 4.2 million gallons , could spill into the Gulf before crews can drill a relief well to alleviate the pressure . \\nBy comparison , the Exxon Valdez , the worst oil spill in U.S. history , leaked 11 million gallons into Alaska 's Prince William Sound in 1989 . \\nCrews working to clean up the spill from the Deepwater Horizon have other things in their favor . \\nOil from the Exxon Valdez can still be found under rocks in the cold water of Prince William Sound , but residue in the Gulf will disappear faster . \\n`` You have warm temperatures , strong sunlight , microbial action . \\nIt will degrade a lot faster , '' said Ronald S. Tjeerdema , an environmental toxicologist at the University of California at Davis who 's studied the effects of oil on aquatic systems . \\n`` Eventually , things will return to normal . '' \\nAnd there 's another bit of good news : The oil spilling out is sweet crude , which is low in sulfur , unlike the oil from the Exxon Valdez , which was heavy crude . \\n`` If you had to pick an oil to spill , this would be it , '' Overton , the LSU oil spill expert , said . \\nBP said Tuesday that it planned to begin drilling a relief well to redirect the leaking oil in a $ 100 million effort to take the pressure off the blown-out well . \\nThe company said it would begin the drilling by Thursday even if crews can shut off oil leaking from the pipe 5,000 feet underground . \\nRobot subs have tried to activate a shut-off device , but so far that has not worked . \\nCompany spokesman Robert Wine said the drilling will take up to three months and will be done from a rig now in place near where the Deepwater Horizon sank . \\nLouisiana-based BP spokesman Neil Chapman said 49 vessels -- oil skimmers , tugboats barges and special recovery boats that separate oil from water -- are working to round up oil . \\nIn Pensacola , Florida , the easternmost point likely to be affected , beachgoers and business owners kept watch . \\n`` I 've been looking at this sand all morning and thinking about the oil spill , '' said Shelley Brunson after a morning swim at Pensacola Beach . \\n`` I am praying they clean it up fast and it does n't come here .

John Kerry 's 2004 presidential campaign . \\nYet his account of the credit crash is personal and revealing , not mere political bashing . \\nHe admits that he did n't recognize that the crisis was about to break and came out of virtual retirement in 2007 to trade again , hoping to limit the damage to his funds . \\nSoros blames former Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan for not intervening to slow the mad real estate boom that led to the subprime mortgage disaster . \\nUnder Greenspan 's leadership , the Federal Reserve kept short-term interest rates too low for too long and ignored the spread of impenetrable financial investments , such as complex mortgage-based securities , which expanded risks of default beyond any reckoning . \\nWhen risk ca n't be figured out and markets turn down , panic often follows . \\n`` The newly invented methods and instruments were so sophisticated that the regulatory authorities lost the ability to calculate the risks involved , '' Soros writes . \\nHe calls this a `` shocking abdication of responsibility on the part of the regulators . '' \\nFINANCIAL SHOCK A 360 Degree Look at the Subprime Mortgage Implosion , and How to Avoid The Next Financial Crisis By Mark Zandi | FT. 270 pp . \\n$ 24.99 Financial Shock by economist Mark Zandi is a clear primer on how and why the crisis occurred . \\nZandi is chief economist and co-founder of Moody 's Economy.com , and his even-handed analysis is often sought by journalists -LRB- including by me in my former role as a Washington Post business reporter -RRB- . \\nHis lucid book explains the credit default swaps -LRB- CDSs -RRB- ; structured investment vehicles -LRB- SIVs -RRB- ; collateralized debt obligations -LRB- CDOs -RRB- ; CDOs of CDOs , called CDOs-squared ; CDOs-cubed ; and other instruments of financial jabberwocky that caused the credit contagion . \\nMost notorious , Zandi says , were the CDOs , `` essentially just a mutual fund for bonds and loans . '' \\nThese funds filled up with subprime mortgage loans whose risks were unknowable to investors . \\nFinancial firms pocketed lucrative fees for selling CDOs , and buyers could get them for 7 percent down , the rest borrowed . \\nSuch highly leveraged deals promised rich payoffs , but delivered cataclysmic losses when the bubble burst . \\nIt is no surprise to see someone like Soros urging effective regulation of financial market risk . \\nBut it is significant that Zandi , an adviser to Sen. John McCain 's presidential campaign , agrees with Soros . \\nThe current crisis , at bottom , is about a serious loss of confidence in U.S. financial markets . \\n`` Financial markets work on trust , '' he says . \\n`` Without trust , money markets quickly break down .

That is why the world has become such a dangerous place . '' \\nSmick built his career through the classic Washington practice of networking and advice-giving , and his analysis is sprinkled with stories of encounters with big players in global finance . \\nHe describes his sweaty-palmed interview with Singapore 's legendary leader Lee Kuan Yew , who blasted Smick for his confidence in U.S. markets , then gave him a consulting contract . \\nIt 's classic name-dropping , but it enlivens his account . \\nSmick views the country 's economic setbacks from the perspective of a committed globalist who fears that Americans will start demanding barriers to trade and investment , provoking an even greater crisis . \\nHis book argues that the United States can and must compete in a world with shrinking boundaries because there really is n't another choice . \\nBAD MONEY Reckless Finance , Failed Politics , And the Global Crisis of American Capitalism By Kevin Phillips | Viking . \\n$ 25.95 Kevin Phillips is alarmed by the increasing gap in wealth between the richest Americans and the rest of the population . \\nOther analysts see this trend coming from political choices , the unplanned chaos of global markets and individual avarice . \\nPhillips , author of American Dynasty and American Theocracy , spies the shadowy hand of the financial elite pulling the strings . \\nAccording to him , since the 1980s , Wall Street and its Washington allies have set out to tie the U.S. economy to the money sector and let manufacturing companies and factory workers fall by the wayside . \\n`` The flight of the economy from tangibles to money manipulation is enriching a broad cross section of the upper-echelon institutions and practitioners of U.S. finance , '' he writes . \\nHe blames this nefarious plan for the current economic crisis and argues that it dooms the United States to second-class status , behind China . \\nThe pitch of Phillips 's alarms has led one reviewer to call him a modern Thomas Paine . \\nBut the sweep of his claims creates a big burden of proof that he does n't even attempt to meet . \\nIs there a powerful cabal at work to carry out a sinister `` financialization '' of the U.S. economy ? \\nPhillips ducks : `` This book will not try to prove or disprove any particular backstage role '' by Wall Street and Washington power brokers . \\nHe is `` not interested in becoming a conspiracy investigator , '' he insists . \\nBut his work edges closer to Dan Brown 's than he should want . \\nOf the four books , Zandi 's account of the internal threats to U.S. prosperity is most clinical while Smick provides a global perspective . \\nSoros , who calls himself a `` failed philosopher '' attempts in his tenth book to put this crisis into a complex theoretical context and asks readers to make one more try to grasp it . \\nAll four authors agree on the growing vulnerability of American financial well-being . \\nAlone among the major economies , the United States is critically dependent on countries that sell us oil , electronics and the things that fill our shopping bags . \\nAmericans have stopped saving . \\nThe Bush administration and Congress have let budget deficits fly . \\nAnd now the country relies on foreigners to plow dollars back in to keep the economy going . \\nThe authors warn that this financial dependence , like our energy dependence , is eroding the nation 's choices . \\nThese four experts see the credit shock as a probable turning point toward an even tougher future . \\nBudget deficits will have to be faced . \\nPainful spending decisions on health care and social security must be made . \\nThe economy 's rewards must flow more fairly . \\n`` Henceforth , American consumers ... have to find ways to live within their means , '' Zandi says . \\n`` Their unlimited freedom to spend , as well as their dominant role in the global economy , -LRB- has -RRB- reached an end .

though in some cases - notably that of the legal memoranda - partial leakage prompted full disclosure . \\nNothing much seems to have been obtained under the Freedom of Information Act . \\nFor Iraqis , already accustomed to unspeakable things happening to anyone detained by Saddam 's police in Abu Ghraib , little can have changed . \\nBut one of America 's leading legal journalists , Anthony Lewis of the New York Times , in an illuminating introduction to The Torture Papers , draws out the grim moral that - in the words of the former national security adviser to George Bush senior , Donald Gregg - it was the legal memoranda that `` cleared the way for the horrors that have been revealed '' in the US-run detention facilities . \\nThese books contain extensive evidence that Lewis and Gregg are right . \\nThey include a mass of depositions and reports about what was going on in the detention facilities . \\nReading the detailed and objective findings of investigating officers , one begins to wonder whether the brutality was not in truth the rogue activity of a few privates , corporals and paramilitaries , while the legal sanctioning of torture thousands of miles away in Washington had more to do with the sophisticated techniques taught over many decades by the US Special Forces and CIA to client dictatorships . \\nBut it becomes inexorably apparent that the crude use of fear and pain on detainees was not simply the localized abuse of absolute power by individuals unfit to hold it . \\nStripping Iraqi men of their clothing and making them wear women 's underwear for days on end , or setting dogs on them when naked , makes a precise fit with the official doctrine that anything short of killing and maiming is a legitimate way of breaking people down for interrogation . \\nEvidence has crept out of Afghanistan of the use of similar techniques there . \\nDanner , in one of his own New York Review of Books articles which introduce his volume , traces `` water-boarding '' -LRB- repeated near-drowning -RRB- from the French war in Algeria through the dirty war in Argentina to the interrogation since 9\\/11 by CIA operatives of `` high value '' suspects in locations which have never been disclosed . \\nDoes even a democracy have nevertheless to countenance such methods when its back is to the wall ? \\nOther democracies have not thought so : many of their governments have refused to pass illiberal laws in response to terrorism , and where some have sought to do so their judiciaries have pointed out that if the reaction to terrorists is to abandon the rule of law , terrorism will have achieved an irreversible victory . \\nThe supreme court of India in 2003 held that India 's prevention of terrorism laws must respect the fundamental human rights recognized in the constitution . \\nThe Israeli supreme court , under its remarkable president Aharon Barak , has - not too successfully , it must be said - told the government and army in a series of judgments that while democracy is fated to fight with one hand tied behind its back , `` none the less , it has the upper hand . \\nPreserving the rule of law and recognition of individual liberties ... strengthen its spirit , and this strength allows it to overcome its difficulties '' . \\nIn this country the law lords , rejecting the legacy of wartime decisions permitting arbitrary executive detention , have found detention without trial a greater evil than the evil it is intended to challenge . \\nPerhaps the strongest evidence that the abuse of prisoners in US hands has been systemic , not aberrant , is the simplest : it is the fact that those involved felt it was quite safe to be photographed repeatedly while committing it . \\nPersonnel who fear disciplinary reprisal , or even disapproval , do not usually make a visual record of their conduct . \\nIf it says something for Donald Rumsfeld , the defense secretary , that he twice tendered his resignation over the Abu Ghraib disclosures , it says rather more about the Bush administration that his offer was on both occasions rejected . \\nThe outcome of the events tracked in these two books , for which both men bear responsibility , is a world order of which the icon has become a hooded figure , its arms outstretched in torment . \\nThe apologists who blame a few bad apples in the barrel might do well to remember what a few bad apples do : they make the whole barrel rotten . \\nStephen Sedley is a judge of the court of appeal for England and Wales Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Review : The Torture Papers and Torture and Truth This article appeared on p14 of the Guardian review section of the Guardian on 01.27 GMT on Saturday 5 March 2005 Latest news and views from the Guardian 's books team paullaity : Read this : clever and funny and rightly cutting .

Bill Gortney said at a press briefing on Monday . \\nThese aircraft fire machine gun rounds from cannons , up to thousands of rounds a minute , and due to their low-altitude flying ability provide more precision in densely populated areas . \\nOn Monday night , one A-10 aircraft attacked Libyan coast guard ships in the port of Misrata after reports were confirmed that the ships were firing at merchant vessels . \\nNATO is set to take control of the full operation in Libya including protecting civilians on Thursday , greatly easing the financial costs on the United States , which has already hit $ 550 million as of Monday , according to Pentagon figures . \\nOf those costs , 60 % were for munitions , the Pentagon said , including Tomahawk missiles , which cost $ 1.4 million each . \\nThe United States has launched approximately 200 since the beginning of the operation . \\n`` Future costs are highly uncertain , '' Pentagon spokeswoman Cmdr. Kathleen Kessler said , but the U.S. expects to incur another $ 40 million in costs over the next three weeks . \\nAfter the transition to NATO control is complete , the Pentagon expects the cost of the U.S. support operation to drop significantly , costing $ 40 million per each subsequent month . \\nCNN 's Pam Benson contributed to this report ", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "Adm.

'' \\n`` The second choice would be for us to contribute to the termination of the clashes in Syria , '' Boroujerdi said . \\n`` The interests of the Muslim people command that we mobilize ourselves to support Syria as a center of Palestinian resistance . '' \\nA senior cleric pressed the message home . \\n`` It is the duty of all Muslims to help stabilize Syria against the destructive plots of America and Israel , '' said Grand Ayatollah Naser Makarem Shirazi . \\nIran also used troops to put down mass protests following the disputed 2009 presidential election . \\nIranian leaders also described those demonstrations as a Western plot . \\nIran had hoped the Arab Spring , something Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei dubbed the `` Islamic Awakening , '' would spell the end of U.S.-backed autocracies and usher in an era of Muslim unity to face-down the West and Israel . \\nKhamenei used the June anniversary of the death of Iran 's revolutionary leader , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , to tell the nation : `` Our stance is clear : wherever a movement is Islamic , popular and anti-American , we support it . '' \\nWithout mentioning Syria by name , he continued : `` If somewhere a movement is provoked by America and Zionists , we will not support it . \\nWherever America and the Zionists enter the scene to topple a regime and occupy a country , we are on the opposite side . '' \\nMohammad Marandi , an associate professor at the University of Tehran , said Iran 's support for Syria was based on a shared interest in helping resistance to Israel -- both countries support Hamas and Hezbollah -- and that continuing to back Assad while he reforms Syria 's one-party system was imperative . \\n`` Iran has always believed that Syria should not be weakened , because the Israeli regime will certainly take advantage of any weakness , '' Marandi told Reuters . \\n`` In any case , real reforms can only be carried out in a peaceful environment . \\nThe Western and pro-Western Arab media campaign against Syria is intended to destabilize the country and to prevent Syria from implementing reforms that will keep Syria strong and an anti-Israeli government in power . '' \\nHe played down media reports of Iran increasing aid to Syria . \\n`` I have not heard of any extraordinary aid delivery , except in the Western media or media outlets owned by despotic Arab regimes . '' \\nWhile civil unrest in Syria has not gone unreported in Iran , it has received far less attention than uprisings in other parts of the region , particularly Bahrain where Saudi Arabia helped a Sunni monarchy put down protests led by majority Shi'ites . \\nIn recent days , as Western media , though banned from working in Syria , have reported a growing death toll , Iranian television has focused more attention on unrest in Britain that some Iranian journalists have described as a `` civil war . '' \\nWith Gulf Arab countries turning against Assad , and Turkey , a bridge between the Middle East and the West , taking a tougher stance , Iranian newspapers reflect Tehran 's growing isolation . \\nAfter distancing his country from Israel and moving closer to the Muslim world since coming to power in 2003 , Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan surprised some in Iran with his volte face . \\n`` In Syria , the state is pointing guns at its own people ... Turkey 's message to Assad is very clear : stop all kinds of violence and bloodshed . '' \\nThe hardline Qods daily said Turkey , instead of showing support for Syria and Iran , had capitulated to U.S. pressure . \\n`` If Recep Tayyip Erdogan 's government does not change its political behavior toward Syria , Turkey will be the main loser of the Syrian events if Damascus gets out of the current crisis , '' it wrote in a recent editorial . \\nThe papers reserved their harshest words for Iran 's Gulf Arab neighbors , particularly Saudi Arabia , whose relations with the mostly non-Arab Iran have become increasingly strained in recent months . \\n`` Stabbing each other 's backs has now become a custom among Arab countries , like the way they previously betrayed Palestine , Libya , Iraq and Sudan . \\nThe current betrayal of Syria should come as no surprise , '' Siyasat-e Ruz daily said in an editorial . \\n`` They are still under this illusion that convergence with America can help them preserve their establishment and restore their lost status in the region , '' the conservative paper said . \\nThey have turned into puppets for the goals of the West . '' \\nReformist daily Arman said Saudi Arabia and Bahrain appeared to be drawing the battle lines for a future regional conflict . \\n`` They want to psychologically prepare the atmosphere so that if there is a conflict with Syria and Iran supports it they are standing on the opposite side and against Iran , '' Arman said . \\n`` All the countries that want to settle a score with Iran would be happy if Iran entered such a conflict and then , in the name of the international community , they would harm Iran . '' \\nThe paper noted the urgent need for Assad to make good on his promised political reforms but with a death toll there which it put at 2,000 , `` it seems late for Bashar al-Assad to get out of this critical situation . '' \\nThe reformist daily concluded that it might soon be time for Tehran to rethink its staunch support for Assad . \\n`` If the Syria situation continues then it 's time for Iran to think about its long term interests , '' it concluded , saying unconditional support for Assad might leave Iran supporting a government `` that has been thrown out of power ... That can have no benefits for itself or Iran .

'' \\nBut that is not to say the oil will totally vanish . \\nThe oil has already been spotted in giant clouds of oil floating in the Gulf of Mexico , but it is still too early to say how much of it is reaching the surface . \\n`` We have never seen these clouds or plumes of oil dispersed in tiny droplets in the water , '' says Mr Senner . \\n`` We do n't know how much is ending up on the bottom . \\nOnshore , we do n't know how much is being buried .

'' \\nThe question everybody will be asking is how quickly can animal numbers return to normal . \\nIt all depends on the life span of the animal . \\nIn the Ixtoc spill of 1979 , there was a 60-70 % reduction in shrimp in the year of the spill , but they were back to normal within one or two years , says Dr McKinney . \\nThen there are longer-lived animals like dolphins , whale sharks and sea turtles . \\nIf a single generation has been largely wiped out , numbers might not fully recover for 10-20 years . \\nAnd then there are the truly long-lived organisms . \\n`` For deepwater solitary coral communities , their lifespan is in hundreds of years , '' says Dr McKinney . \\nWhat will the effect of widespread use of the dispersant Corexit be ? \\nWill migrating birds be severely affected ? \\nHow much oil has actually been spilled ? \\nHow much is buried in fragile wetland habitats ? \\nWhat is the effect of oil on deep-sea ecosystems ? \\nThey could potentially be vulnerable to the oil or to patches of oxygen-depleted water created by the oil-eating microbes . \\nWhen the microbes degrade the oil , oxygen is used up and carbon dioxide is produced . \\nDr McKinney is worried about `` huge clouds of low-oxygen oil dispersant mix , -LRB- which is -RRB- methane-heavy '' . \\nThe plus side for fish stocks on the other hand is that , severe as the damage might be , it will be mitigated by the break in fishing . \\n`` They have closed such large areas of the Gulf that the pressure has been reduced , '' says Dr McKinney . \\n`` Reducing the fishing pressure will allow more fish to remain alive and reproduce . '' \\nSo stocks of fish like red snapper could be back to normal within two to four years . \\nBut , the effect of the spill on species that are already under immense pressure - like Atlantic bluefin tuna - could be severe . \\nHOW WILL ECOSYSTEMS BE CHANGED ? \\n`` In ecosystems , when you wipe out large segments of them , the ecosystem responds to the absence of those things and other things come in to take their place and you do n't return to the way things were , '' says Mr Senner . \\n`` Ecosystems are always dynamic . \\nWhat we see in the Gulf of Mexico is an ecosystem that already had a number of stresses on it . '' \\nSome animals and plants may be badly affected by the disruption of the spill and not regain their previous place in the ecosystem once conditions return to normal . \\nBut they will be replaced by other organisms . \\nA lot of the thinking about the effects of the BP oil spill is informed by the work done following the Ixtoc spill of 1979 . \\nBut there are some aspects of the latest spill about which scientists find it hard even to speculate . \\nMarine biologists will admit that not a great deal is known about the effects of oil on organisms in deep water . \\n`` We know almost nothing about the ecology in the deep ocean , '' says Prof Overton . \\nIt may offer only a crumb of comfort , but the 2010 spill will one day provide that knowledge . \\nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

\\nAndrew Stephen examines Christopher Meyer 's DC Confidential Weidenfeld & Nicholson # 20 , pp301 Becoming Britain 's ambassador to Washington is invariably the high point of a diplomat 's career . \\nFive have occupied the faux Queen Anne ambassadorial residence on Massachusetts Avenue since I went to Washington to become The Observer 's correspondent there in 1989 , all with varying success : Sir Antony Acland -LRB- 1986-91 -RRB- returned to become provost of Eton , Sir Robin -LRB- now Lord -RRB- Renwick -LRB- 1991-95 -RRB- to write a learned tome on Anglo-American relations , and Sir John -LRB- now Lord -RRB- Kerr -LRB- 1995-97 -RRB- to become permanent under-secretary at the foreign office . \\nThe fourth , Sir Christopher Meyer -LRB- 1997-2003 -RRB- , went back to London to become chairman of the Press Complaints Commission and to publish these tell-all memoirs , which , the publisher confidently informs us , will do for diplomacy what Alan Clark 's did for politics . \\nMeyer was once press secretary to John Major , and so few will better understand the peculiarly British nature of the briefings that began last week : that Meyer has breached the sacred trusts of government , that he is doing it solely for the money and to settle old scores , and that his chairmanship of the PCC is now untenable . \\nAll of which may or may not be true . \\nBut hell , it seems , hath no fury quite like that of a scorned Prime Minister , especially after a master practitioner of Establishment wiles like Meyer managed to outsmart Tony Blair by giving the cabinet office just days to review this book before rushing it into print . \\nSir Jeremy Greenstock , Meyer 's ambassadorial colleague at the UN during the run-up to the Iraq war , gave the government longer and paid the price ; his apparently equally revealing book , The Costs of War , will now not be seeing the light of day on the personal orders , we are told , of Jack Straw . \\nWhat other Western country , I wonder , so freely tolerates such censorship ? \\nPerhaps we should not be surprised . \\nMeyer 's detailed account of Blair 's life in the White House is not only rich in details about his time in Washington . \\nWe learn how the Prime Minister ` pulsed with ill-suppressed excitement ' during his first official visit to the US ; how he put on ' a pair of ball-crushingly tight dark-blue corduroys ' after ` intensive debate within No 10 ' on what was meant by informal dress ; and of the near-catastrophe when Mrs Blair 's hairdresser was left behind at Camp David , averted only when a chopper was sent for him ` as the rest of us kicked our heels ' . \\nBut such knockabout stuff would be mere cruel diversion were the book not also a tragic indictment of the dysfunction of 21st-century British government - the marginalisation of the Foreign Office and the soaring ascendancy of Blairite courtiers - and of the dangers of voting into office a party whose leader had nil governmental experience . \\n` We want you to get up the arse of the White House and stay there , ' is the instruction Meyer says he received from Blair 's chief of staff , Jonathan Powell . \\nIndeed , bitterness and resentment pulse through this book once Blair starts to stalk its pages . \\nMeyer 's version of history is that he and the Foreign Office were soon jettisoned in favor of the superstar politicking to which Blair gravitated ; that , in the year leading up to the Iraq invasion , his embassy warned London of the defective plans Washington was making and its rudimentary notions of how the country would be administered after Saddam . \\nMeyer concedes that he was in favor of invading Iraq and even that he found George W Bush ` as smart as a whip ' , but believes that Downing Street had a vendetta against the embassy which ultimately led to its fatal misjudgments . \\nWe will not know how much of this is justified until government papers are released sometime in the 2030s , or until and when Greenstock and other privileged insiders are free to have their say , too . \\nWhat is clear , though , is that Blair simply failed to comprehend that neocons such as Paul Wolfowitz and Richard Perle , whom Meyer says Colin Powell privately dismissed as ` fucking crazies ' , saw Iraq as ` the anvil on which they could forge a realignment of the Middle East ' , and that Britain was being inexorably dragged down their path . \\nThose same neocons also see a strong Europe as a threat to American hegemony , and Meyer describes how Rupert Murdoch and senior Republicans complained to him over dinner about Britain 's ` appeasement ' towards France ; such mutterings from the American right alone , it seems , were soon enough for Blair to abandon Churchill 's long-held strategy that British support for a powerful US must be balanced by strong ties to both Europe and the Commonwealth . \\n` Blair 's famous bridge between Europe and America , ' Meyer notes , ` was sinking beneath the waves . ' \\nHis central thesis , though , that ` the ace up our sleeve was that America did not want to go alone ' into Iraq , simply does not stand up . \\nBritain has always relished the deceit that , when it comes to the so-called special relationship , it plays the role of the cultured and intellectually superior Athenian murmuring words of wisdom into the ear of the mightier but uncouth Roman . \\nThe truth is that Washington 's ear always remains resolutely deaf unless what is said is something it wants to hear . \\nBlair mouthed only sweet nothings but America would still have stormed to war with or without Britain , as Donald Rumsfeld made derisively clear at the time . \\nMeyer , besides , has done himself no favors with this book . \\nHe emerges not so much as the Sir Crispin Mandarin of Private Eye parody but more , sometimes , as Dame Sylvie Krin . \\nEccentrically , he habitually wore red socks and he and his wife captivated Washington in a way I have never seen - perhaps the Blairites were jealous ? \\n- but we read too much about his laddish ways , such as how he was ` looking at Catherine 's legs ' at the British embassy in Bonn while ` she sensed my eyes boring into her calves like red-hot pokers ' . \\nWhat would now be fascinating to read would be the memoirs of the fifth occupant during my time of what Meyer repeatedly calls that Great House - those of Sir David Manning , the present ambassador . \\nHe straddled the roles of Foreign Office diplomat and inner-cabal adviser and was at Blair 's side throughout the build-up to war and beyond . \\nMeyer , in fact , is still beside himself that he learned Manning was to succeed him not from the British government , but from Washington . \\nSo does Blair , I wonder , now listen to Manning any more than he did to Meyer ? \\nDoes Manning agree that the role of the British ambassador is to stay up the arse of the White House ? \\nAnd what would Manning himself make of Bush ` splitting his sides ' when he learns that a character in a film is called Gay Focker ? \\nDid he relish his ambassadorial task introducing Cherie Blair on the stage of the Kennedy Centre when she was promoting her money-spinning book ? \\nWe would all love to know . \\nBut given the experiences that have befallen both Greenstock and Meyer in Blair 's brave new Britain , I very much doubt whether we will . \\nEducation Lancing College ; Lycee Henri IV , Paris ; Peterhouse College , Cambridge ; Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies , Bologna . \\nCareer Ambassador to Germany -LRB- Mar-Oct 1997 -RRB- ; Ambassador to the US -LRB- 1997-2003 -RRB- ; chairman , Press Complaints Commission -LRB- 2004-present -RRB- . \\nFamily Married to Lady Catherine Laylle . \\nOn Blair : ` He liked the vision thing , but he was n't interested in the ballast behind the ideas .

William Gortney said at a Pentagon briefing . \\nThe U.S. will conduct a damage assessment of the sites , which include SA-5 missiles and communications facilities . \\nA senior U.S. military official , who was not authorized to speak on the record , said the cruise missiles , which fly close to the ground or sea at about 550 miles per hour , landed near Misrata and Tripoli . \\nThe salvo , in an operation dubbed `` Odyssey Dawn , '' was meant `` to deny the Libyan regime from using force against its own people , '' said Gortney . \\nU.S. Navy photos showed flashes of light and smoke funnels as missiles soared from a destroyer into the night sky . \\nEarlier , French fighter jets deployed over Libya fired at a military vehicle Saturday , the first strike against Gadhafi 's military forces , which earlier attacked the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . \\nPrime Minister David Cameron said late Saturday that British forces also are in action over Libya . \\n`` What we are doing is necessary , it is legal and it is right , '' he said . \\n`` I believe we should not stand aside while this dictator murders his own people .

Mike Mullen said Sunday . \\nThe coalition forces , including U.S. , British and French aircraft , have taken out most of Libya 's air defense systems and some airfields , Mullen said in interviews on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' program and other networks . \\nHe is not a legitimate leader \\n`` I would say the no-fly zone is effectively in place , '' Mullen told CNN , adding that the strategy now is to cut off logistical support for Gadhafi 's forces that are `` pretty spread out '' from Tripoli to Benghazi . \\nMullen also said Gadhafi 's forces had shown little ability to take on the coalition firepower so far , and he made clear that the scope of the mission was limited , involving creation of the no-fly zone , stopping attacks on civilians and allowing humanitarian operations to proceed . \\nHe acknowledged on NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' that the military mission could be completed with Gadhafi still in power . \\nFighter jets hit Libyan army convoy Action taken to stop Gadhafi Obama : No ground troops in Libya `` He 's a thug , he 's a cagey guy , he 's a survivor . \\nWe know that , '' Mullen said of Gadhafi on the CBS program `` Face the Nation , '' noting that the Libyan leader has access to large quantities of mustard gas that concern the United States . \\n`` It 's something he could do a lot of damage with , '' Mullen said , adding that coalition forces were closely monitoring the situation and , so far , `` have n't seen him move in that direction . '' \\nU.S. President Barack Obama had been under mounting pressure from Republican critics and some Democrats to take steps against Gadhafi . \\nOn Sunday 's talk shows , all U.S. politicians interviewed welcomed the new military mission , but some worried it was too late or too limited to do the necessary job of taking out Gadhafi . \\n`` Isolate , strangle and replace this man -- that should be our goal , '' Republican Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina told `` FOX News Sunday . '' \\nIn particular , Graham took issue with Obama 's insistence on getting a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the mission as well as Arab League endorsement as a strategy to prevent accusations of a U.S. vendetta against the Islamic world . \\n`` I think the president ` caveated ' this way too much , it 's almost like it 's a nuisance , '' Graham said . \\n`` This is a great opportunity to replace a tyrannical dictator who is not a legitimate leader , who is an international crook . \\nAnd we should seize the moment and talk about replacing him , not talking about how limited we will be . '' \\nHowever , Mullen and Democrats said gaining international consensus for the mission was crucial , and Mullen made clear that the U.S. role would be limited , telling NBC that `` we 're not going to put any boots on the ground . \\nThis is n't about occupation in any shape or form . '' \\nDemocratic Senator Jack Reed of Rhode Island told reporters that the best outcome `` would be for Gadhafi and his family to recognize that they are illegitimate rulers of the country and to depart the scene , allowing the United Nations , politically , to organize a popular referendum or some democratic means to establish a new government . '' \\n`` If Gadhafi chooses not to go , then , I think , there will be a longer period of conflict , '' Reed said . \\n`` But I just sense that given this incredible unified opposition to him , particularly the Arab League , that the signal has to be clear that his days are numbered . '' \\nFor now , Mullen told CNN , `` we would like to see him withdraw his forces across the country back into garrison '' and stop attacking his people . \\nWhen told that Gadhafi was claiming women and children had been killed in the coalition air strikes , Mullen said on CNN that the targets were selected carefully , adding : `` I 've seen no reports of significant civilian casualties . '' \\nOn other networks , he said he was unaware of any civilian casualties so far . \\nAs part of the no-fly zone , coalition combat aircraft will be patrolling over Benghazi at all times , Mullen told CNN . \\nCoalition forces also are looking to jam communications of Gadhafi 's forces in what Mullen called the `` first phase of a multifaceted '' operation . \\n`` While we 're leading it now , we 're looking to hand off that leadership in the next few days , '' Mullen said on NBC . \\nOn the same show , Democratic Senator Carl Levin of Michigan , the chairman of the Armed Services Committee , said Britain , France and Arab nations would assume control of the mission . \\nMullen said he expected Arab countries that supported the mission to begin contributing military help . \\nOn Sunday , the French Defense Ministry announced that Qatar has offered to contribute four fighter planes to the coalition effort . \\nHouse Speaker John Boehner , R-Ohio , issued a statement Sunday calling for Obama to provide more explanation on the military mission . \\n`` Before any further military commitments are made , the administration must do a better job of communicating to the American people and to Congress about our mission in Libya and how it will be achieved , '' Boehner 's statement said . \\nTo Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona , Obama waited too long to take action in Libya . \\n`` We need now to support him and the efforts that our military are going to make , '' McCain told CNN in an interview taped Friday and broadcast Sunday . \\n`` And I regret that it did n't -- we did n't act much more quickly , and we could have . '' \\nMcCain , the ranking GOP member of the Senate Armed Services Committee , said if the United States had acted a few weeks ago , a no-fly zone `` would probably have been enough '' to prevent the situation in the African country from deteriorating . \\nEven so , he said , time is now against Gadhafi . \\n`` If he -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- does n't succeed in a relatively short period of time , he 'll be driven back and , over time , I believe , defeated , '' McCain said . \\n`` I have great confidence in our capabilities that the most mightiest nation in the world is now matched up against a third-rate or fourth-rate power . '' \\nAsked if the United States waited too long , Mullen answered that it was impossible to say what might have changed if there had been earlier U.S. action . \\nHe emphasized the importance of gaining international consensus and assistance for the military mission launched almost exactly on the eighth anniversary of the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq in 2003 , saying : `` This was n't something the United States ginned up .

Peter Beaumont and Jason Burke ask what factors - physical , psychological and moral - create a heroic act The following correction was printed in the Guardian 's Corrections and clarifications column , Sunday March 27 , 2005 In the article below we said Colonel Herbert ` H ' Jones and Sergeant Ian McKay were awarded the VC for their role in the attack on Goose Green . In fact , Sergeant McKay 's VC was awarded for his bravery during an attack on an enemy position on Mount Longdon , an objective in the battle for Port Stanley . ` Heroism ' , wrote Ralph Waldo Emerson , ` is an obedience to a secret impulse of an individual 's character . ' It is a mystery , war 's great enigma - what is it that makes one man run , another stand his ground , and an exceptional few display unusual courage . It is a question that can only be answered by the fact that Johnson Beharry was last week awarded the Victoria Cross for his acts of bravery during the Iraq war . Herbert ` H ' Jones implied , `` he is a man of valor '' . He is only the 1,354 th recipient since the medal was instituted in 1854 - and only the 11th since the end of the Second World War . And what underlies that question of heroism is not simply the details of his extraordinary valor as they were detailed last week , but by the pictures of Beharry himself . They showed an open , easy and smiling face - comfortable , perhaps even a little shy - reinforcing his humanity . They were pictures that insisted that we ask : what was it that made this ordinary man do such extraordinary things ? It is a question , in truth , as old as writing and humanity itself - and one that only now scientists are beginning to understand . Homer took it as his theme in the Iliad , his depiction of the characters of two great and flawed warriors - Achilles and Hector - while Plato and Aristotle dissected what it meant for the citizen soldier . The Old Testament authors presented their own archetypes for heroism , none more powerfully described than David 's struggle against Goliath . In the last century , however , biologists and social scientists , physiologists and psychologists began to attempt to define Emerson 's ` secret impulse ' and the core nature of heroism itself . It is a question that has been muddied by the fact that the idea of heroism at any time is defined by broader social values and shifting cultural perceptions . The traditional meaning that accrued to it in the field of military endeavor was , perhaps , best expressed by Churchill 's physician , Lord Moran , who took two views of courage in his book , The Anatomy of Courage - as a ` true virtue ' , and as a special case of self-control . He rejected , too , the idea of courage as a constant . Instead he took the view that it was inevitably exhaustible . Most of all , believed Moran , it had to involve a conscious decision . ` Courage is a moral quality , ' wrote Lord Moran . ` It is not a chance gift of nature like an aptitude for games . It is a cold choice between two alternatives , the fixed resolve not to quit ; an act of renunciation which must be made not once but many times by the power of the will . ' It is a definition that could have been written for Johnson Beharry . The story of Beharry 's heroism , however , is doubly meaningful because his story transcends the traditional idea of martial valor - that its function is violence alone - and incorporates more modern civil notions that real heroes are just those ordinary people who put themselves at risk to help others . The 24-year-old armored vehicle driver was at the head of a five-vehicle convoy that came under attack on the outskirts of the central Iraqi city of Amara on the night of 1 May last year . The vehicle Beharry was driving was hit by a barrage of rocket-propelled grenades , leaving the platoon commanding officer unconscious and presumed dead , and engulfing the vehicle in flames . Beharry , determined to get the casualties to safety and create a path for the other vehicles to follow , rammed a barricade and drove on through thick smoke and a mile-long ambush with his protective hatch blasted open . He eventually delivered the troops to a secure area , twice returning to the vehicle under fire to carry the wounded inside a compound . Weeks later , his Warrior was ambushed again and a rocket exploded six inches away from him , causing serious head injuries . He managed to reverse the Warrior and its occupants out of danger before collapsing into a coma . They were actions that meant Beharry would become the first living recipient of a Victoria Cross -LRB- VC -RRB- since 1965 , and the first to get the medal since the 1982 Falklands conflict when Colonel Herbert ` H ' Jones and Sergeant Ian McKay were awarded the VC posthumously for their role in the attack on Goose Green . Indeed , military experts believe that the award of the VC to Beharry signalled a recognition of the change in the army 's role . ` For a long time the feeling was that the Victoria Cross should be reserved for gallantry in conventional war rather than the `` low-intensity conflicts '' that the British Army has primarily been involved in recently , ' said Andrew Dorman , a lecturer in Defense Studies at King 's College London . Dorman said last week 's VC showed a recognition both that ` extreme gallantry is the same whatever ' , a belief recognized by Beharry 's fellow soldiers , who launched the campaign for him to be given the Victoria Cross after senior officers recommended him for honors . But was there something in Beharry 's background that conditioned him for courage ? The son of a Grenadan brickmaker who came to the United Kingdom in 1999 , Johnson grew up in a wooden hut without running water that he shared with his parents and seven brothers and sisters . In interviews last week , his parents said that Johnson , who had enjoyed playing childhood war-games with his friends , had always dreamed of joining the British Army , leaving school at 14 . Beharry 's modest upbringing is one that he shares with other soldiers who have displayed the highest gallantry in war , including Audie Murphy , America 's most decorated soldier of World War Two , whose parents were dirt-poor sharecroppers , and Albert Jacka VC , the Australian hero of Gallipoli , a forestry labourer who rose rapidly through the ranks . Yet none of this explains why some people are predisposed to be courageous , and in a way the majority are not . This question has obsessed military commanders from the first decade of the last century onwards as they enlisted the new social sciences to try to find ways of persuading soldiers to be more aggressive - courageous in the traditional military sense . It is the search for the roots of courage that was chronicled by Joanna Bourke of Birkbeck College in her book An Intimate History of Killing . ` There was a problem : the instinct of self-preservation was as liable to lead to `` flight '' as to `` fight '' , ' wrote Bourke about the early attempts to understand valor . ` To overcome this , military psychologists coupled instinct theory with the crowd psychology of men like Gustave Le Bon and his English populariser , Wilfred Trotter . ` Humans were herd animals , with strong gregarious impulses . In a crowd - and the army was only a trained crowd - the `` group mind '' would take over , endowing the individual with a sense of almost limitless power and immortality . ' That was the theory for a while at least . But it still did not explain why some soldiers were prepared to take more risks than others . By the Fifties , research was hinting at other explanations . The British psychologist , Hans Eysenck , developed a scale to measure the personality trait of extroversion , now regarded by psychologists as one of the most consistent predictors of risk-taking .

Although it 's not been officially confirmed , it 's understood that the first person with H1N1 swine flu to die in Britain was a 38-year-old mother who had given birth prematurely . The patient , who has not yet been named , was admitted to hospital with swine flu and gave birth earlier this month to a premature baby . The Scottish Health Protection Agency -LRB- SPA -RRB- has confirmed the death of a woman in Glasgow . Few details have yet been confirmed by the Scottish authorities ; they have so far said only that the patient had `` underlying health conditions '' . Her death is very sad news , and everyone 's thoughts must be with her family , friends and the medical staff who cared for her . Before I go on to discuss the elevated risks of swine flu associated with pregnancy , it 's important to stress , as I do repeatedly , that the vast majority of people who contract this virus have a mild disease which lasts a few days . Many will have no symptoms at all . The official figure for the UK is 1,261 cases and this is the first death . But there will have been hundreds - maybe many thousands - of cases which have gone unrecorded . So instead of being one death in 1,261 cases , it is undoubtedly a lot less than that . With around 700,000 babies born in the UK each year , I know that many women and their partners will be concerned . So please be reassured that the vast majority of pregnant women who get infected will be okay , as will their unborn children . Having put all those caveats in place , it is true that pregnancy is a risk factor for swine flu . The director general of the World Health Organization , Margaret Chan , had this to say about pregnancy last week , in her speech declaring a flu pandemic : `` Without question , pregnant women are at increased risk of complications . This heightened risk takes on added importance for a virus , like this one , that preferentially infects younger age groups . '' But remember that pregnancy is also a risk factor for seasonal flu , especially in the last trimester . Flu poses a threat both to the mother and to the unborn child . Among the complications , the fever associated with flu can lead to a premature delivery . Health advisers recommended three years ago that pregnant women should be among the groups offered a seasonal flu jab . When a vaccine for H1N1 swine flu becomes available in the autumn , pregnant women may well be among the first `` at risk '' groups offered the jab . What about antiviral drugs and pregnancy ? During pregnancy , the concern with any drug is that it may pass through the placenta and affect the baby . There is a risk factor especially during the first trimester . Oseltamivir -LRB- currently best known as the brand name Tamiflu -RRB- is not usually recommended for pregnant women because the side-effects are unknown . But the lesser-known inhaled drug Relenza -LRB- a brand name for zanamivir -RRB- can be prescribed on medical advice , according to the Department of Health . `` An expert group reviewed the risk of antiviral treatment in pregnancy , which is extremely small - much smaller than the risk posed by the symptoms of swine flu . '' There are more details on pregnancy and swine flu on the government health pages . At 11:07 am on 15 Jun 2009 , sensiblegrannie wrote : Give pregnant women massive priority . The health authorities are dealing with two people , not one . Pregnancy and childbirth is a high risk time all of the time . If it is unwise to give certain antiviral drugs to pregnant women then it stands to reason , to reduce unnecessary contact with the rest of us until such time as the baby is born . We can reduce the risk to pregnant mums by keeping well away if we have been in contact with or have this new flu . Shopping for food online is a bit safer than the weekly scrum in the supermarket . Get someone else to do the supermarket run . Anti natal appointments could be run from an alternative location away from the germ ridden doctors surgery . Luckily , most hospitals for childbirth are set apart from the general hospitals . Home deliveries are risky at the best of times and should not be an alternative for safe hospital delivery , where specialists are always at hand . Pregnant mums may already have a toddler at the local nursery , playgroup or school . Other mums could reduce the risk of flu contact , by making sure their own children do not have symptoms of flu or other infectious diseases before sending them of to school each morning . It only takes two minutes to check a temperature . Schools and nurseries could be more pro-active and less politically correct and simply refuse to allow a child to attend if they are obviously ill . The temptation will be , to allow a child back to nursery before the child has got over the infectious stage , if the child appears apparently well . Do n't forget , if you knowingly take risks , you risk the health of others . That 's the first time - as far as I 'm aware - that anyone from government , or any journalist , has actually admitted that there may well be a significant difference between the ` official ' figure and the real figure of infections . Now , as has already been stated on these blogs , the official figure is the number of reported and confirmed cases - and it may be relevant to consider that some , perhaps even many , of these persons have recovered from the infection and would no longer be an infection risk to others . So in terms of people assessing how likely it is that they will come into direct or indirect contact with an infectious person and thereby risk becoming infected - these figures are particularly useless in many respects . And is n't that really what people want some idea about ? The risk to them ? In fact , I almost wonder why the government is bothering to constantly publish these figures and the media report them !

There is very little information about the virus and pregnant women in general , and I notice that even though there is a lot of data already collected by WHO about the cases -LRB- and disproportinately high number of cases involving pregnant women -RRB- the official documents regarding the virus have not been updated since they were first issued . It is appalling that only with the first lethal case some more information is siphoning through the media , though barely adequate . Here is an idea to chew on . A mad , random , scientific idea is that bacteria make the rain fall . The info is on the BBC site today and is on radio 4 tonight at 9 pm . As a child , when it rained , I was always told to wear a rain mac , dry my hair thoroughly , take an umbrella with me or I ` would catch my death of cold ' if I got wet in the rain . It always used to puzzle me because the same restrictions were not in place when I went to the beach and enjoyed bathing in the sea . Are viruses able to temporarily host on the bacteria that ` seed ' the rain and possibly make rain fall ? It is interesting , because if bacteria can alter the temperature that rain freezes , then it might explain why antifreeze works or why salt prevents water freezing at zero . The bacteria are being killed or attenuated by the salt and alcohol . Fergus , I would echo Sutara 's comment above .

KYRA PHILLIPS , CNN ANCHOR : OK . It 's the top of the hour , and it 's Monday , 10:00 a.m. in the east , 14 minutes to sunrise in San Francisco , right now we 're watching the midwest in that dangerous winter storm that could bury old snow records in St. Louis and Chicago . The system could trigger tornadoes in the south and it could batter the east cost by Thursday . Then near Seattle , a vigil for a corrections officer found dead in a prison chapel . It 's believed that an inmate serving life for rape and assault strangled her as she was trying to escape . The victim , Jamie Vindal was the only guard working in the chapel . The superintendent said she did n't even carry a weapon , the inmate is now in an isolated unit and has asked for a lawyer . And the government 's new dietary guidelines out today , if you love sugar , salt and big sticks of margarine , you 're out of luck , the fed say cut that out . Eat more seafood , fruits and veggies . It 's now 5:00 p.m. in Egypt and a curfew is in place and Hosni Mubarak remains in power . This morning he swore in a new cabinet in his latest concession to anti-government protesters . MOHAMED ELBARADEI , NOBEL PEACE LAUREATE -LRB- via phone -RRB- : I will continue to participate in whatever it takes to make sure that the Mubarak regime should leave . I think that 's a terrifying - that is a consensus here in Egypt , in every part of society that this is a regime that dictatorial , that has failed to deliver on economic , social or political fronts , and that we need a new beginning in Egypt that is free and that is democratic , and we 're watching the midwest in San Francisco , right now we MOHAMED ELBARADEI , NOBEL PEACE LAUREATE -LRB- via phone -RRB- : I will continue to participate in whatever it takes to make sure that the Mubarak regime should leave . I think that 's a - that is a consensus here in Egypt , in every part of society that this is a regime that is dictatorial , that has failed to deliver on economic , social or political fronts , and that we need a new beginning in Egypt that is free and that is democratic , and we need to go through a transitional period . PHILLIPS : But on the seventh day of protests , some stark realities hitting home . Food shortages becoming commonplace . People waiting in lines for hours to buy bread . Store shelves becoming empty . Lawlessness reaching a new level as well . Prisons empty with murderers , rapists , terrorists running free . And a show of brazen defiance , citizens then looted those prisons themselves . Now all eyes remain on the country 's military on what role it 's going to play in the uprising . Fighters igniting fear and rumors yesterday when they buzz crowds of protesters and some people felt panicked because they thought they were about to be bombed . Now out of the chaos , Mohammed Elbaradei is emerging as a leading figure of the opposition . The name might sound familiar . He used to head up the U.N. nuclear watchdog agency . And yesterday , he joined the crowds in Cairo 's -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- Square . A move that energized many of those protesters . Our Fred Pleitgen was right there earlier this morning . And he told us what he saw at street level . FREDERICK PLEITGEN , CNN INTERNATIONAL CORRESPONDENT -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Police forces absolutely vanished off the street here . There is some talk that it might return today . We 're not exactly sure that 's going to be the case but simply that 's something that is really being discussed and is the talk of the town . That could actually spur new unrest , because it was the heavy-handedness of the police that caused the riot here last Friday . But right now , there 's no police present . I was going around Cairo yesterday , in the suburbs , and we went past seven or eight police stations , which all of them had been abandoned , looted and burned down . There is an air of lawlessness where a lot of people are defending their own homes with everything they can find from samurai swords to clubs to rifle . So right now there is n't much in the way of any law enforcement authority . And the ones that are sort of trying to keep order is the military . PHILLIPS : Well , the U.S. is evacuating Americans who want to escape that turmoil in Egypt . And U.S. citizens are gathering now in Cairo 's main airport . The first charter flight has already taken off . The evacuees will be responsible for the costs of their flights , and according to the State Department , there are about 52,000 Americans registered with the embassy in Cairo . So far , 2,400 Americans have already been asked to evacuate . Now , for those who want to stay , the State Department is urging them to limit their movements , and keep a close eye on this escalating crisis .

Laura joins me on the phone from Alexandria , Egypt . So Lara , describe what you 've seen and what it 's been like for you ? LARA GETZ , STRANDED STUDENT : Well , first of all , I should probably clarify that I 'm just one student from Tulane . We 're a group of about 20 different students from different programs here , but it 's been a really , you know , extraordinary and pretty life-changing experience . You know , right know , we 're waiting to get out , but you know , starting on Friday we were able to see the Egyptian people finally stand up to a government that 's been extremely oppressive for about 30 years now and you know , take to the streets in a unified effort , despite the president 's efforts in limiting that . I mean , he cut off the internet . He cut off all mobile services , so there 's no communication among people and yet everyone 's still banded together . It has , you know , been a mixture of experiences . It has been frightening at times , since it 's been getting violent between people looting and you know , some of the criminals getting out . So , you know people running around . People have weapons now , but what has been really extraordinary as well has been to see how the Egyptian people have really united over all of this , and that , you know , in the neighborhoods we have been seeing people - we know people who are pretty much setting up watches and guards , and having people from all different walks of life , professors , street shop owners , young people , to like an 80-year-old man coming down and guarding their buildings and their friends and families and neighborhoods . So , you know , on the one hand you see , yes , it 's become violent and it 's unfortunately come to this state , and the president has refused to step down . On the other hand , you 've also seen a people really unite and show that they can really work together . PHILLIPS : Lara , you 've been mixing with college students since you 've been there , with other college students and you know , the average age is 20-something , 30-something , the younger generation that 's out there in protest .

Hopes of finding survivors in the rubble are fading and the focus is now on getting urgent aid into and around the country . 2300 The BBC is discontinuing this live update page for the night . For the latest developments , please go to our main news page . 2259 The BBC 's Andy Gallagher in Port-au-Prince says : `` The airport is now busier than ever . But even as the plans land , and the supplies are unloaded , there are major problems distributing the aid . Much of it remains on the runway - tents , blankets and medical supplies sitting unused . Military personnel told me the logistical complexity of working out of such a tiny airport is a major stumbling block . But the fact remains that very little aid has reached those who need it . In the city itself , I have seen the UN handing out supplies . But it is the injured and dying who require most help . Haiti has now handed over control of the airport to the US , a move that could finally speed up the relief effort . '' 2255 Lord Malloch Brown , the former UN deputy secretary general , tells the BBC that the rescue effort has been damaged by the loss of much of the UN team in Haiti , but that it is well-placed to recover quickly . `` Obviously any organization which so tragically has its leadership decapitated is in chaos for a bit . But in fact the UN is much bigger in Port-au-Prince than it is in most places in the world because of the big peacekeeping operation there . The UN is in a better place to regroup and recover than would be the case in many parts of the world where natural disasters strike and the UN has almost no presence . But I think the really big factor here is the proximity to the US , which is able to project by far the most capable logistics operations in crises like this , '' he says . 2237 US Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano says undocumented Haitians in the United States will be granted `` temporary protected status '' , which will allow those eligible to continue living and working there for the next 18 months . There are an estimated 30,000 Haitians living illegally in the US . TPS is granted to foreigners who may not be able to return safely to their country because of a natural disaster , armed conflict or other reasons . 2228 UK International Development Secretary Douglas Alexander tells the BBC those involved in the aid operation are working against the clock . `` We are acutely aware that at this stage in the crisis every hour matters - that 's why we have our British firefighters on the ground already , trying to save lives . We 'll be working round the clock to make sure not just that we save lives , but we tend to the needs of those who have been left devastated by this terrible earthquake .

I ca n't imagine the terrible pain and suffering they are experiencing , '' she says . 2219 The BBC 's Matthew Price in Port-au-Prince says : `` I have been standing outside a nursing college in the capital for several hours . One desperate woman , who is part of the management team , has told me that inside the remains of the college , which used to be five storeys high , there are 260 dead bodies and 25 people still alive , even after three days . She says the principal has received a text message from inside to that effect . A Brazilian rescue team has been trying to get access to them , but progress has been very slow . The several hundred locals gathered nearby are getting increasing alarmed . '' 2208The BBC 's Nick Davis in Port-au-Prince says : `` On one of the main roads from the airport into the city , you would expect to see convoys of trucks carrying aid . But there are n't any . A logjam at the airport caused by the logistical nightmare of the earthquake , and the poor infrastructure that existed before Tuesday , makes getting the help where it is needed almost impossible . At one cemetery nearby , bodies have been turning up all day . The hope is the urgent supplies will arrive before more die . '' 2202 The commander of the USS Carl Vinson , Adm Ted Branch , tells the BBC that more food supplies are expected in Haiti on Saturday as they arrive from the US military base at Guantanamo Bay . A shorter flying time has been made possible by an agreement with Cuba allowing US relief flights to use Cuban air space . `` When the supplies do start to rolling in , we 'll have our procedures in order , and we 'll be able to more efficiently deliver the relief , '' he says . 2156 Apparent delays in aid reaching survivors have prompted anger across Haiti , and there have been reports of looting . But Ian Rodgers of Save the Children says its teams in Port-au-Prince have not seen any evidence of crime . `` As we move through areas , people are desperately expressing what their needs are , and calling for assistance . But the population is still at this point being very , very supportive , '' he tells the BBC . People ran from police when they tried to stop supplies being taken from shops 2149 Mrs Clinton says they will remain at Port-au-Prince 's airport during the visit and will not be using any valuable resources needed for the relief effort . She said she had been asked to come by Haiti . 2142 US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton says at a news conference that she will go to Haiti on Saturday with USAID administrator Rajiv Shah . `` We will be meeting President -LRB- Rene -RRB- Preval and other members of the Haitian government along with the members of the US government team on the ground , '' she says . 2130 UN humanitarian chief John Holmes launches a flash appeal for $ 562m , saying the aid is needed for three million people affected by the earthquake for a period of six months . 2056 Reuters news agency quotes secretary of state for public safety Aramick Louis as saying the authorities have buried 40,000 bodies and believe another 100,000 probably died . 2045 Haiti 's Prime Minister , Jean-Max Bellerive , says more than 15,000 bodies have been collected by the authorities since Tuesday , according to the AFP news agency . Earlier it reported that Haitian Public Health Minister Alex Larsen had told a news conference that 50,000 people had been killed and 250,000 injured 2032 Gen Douglas Fraser , the commander of US SOUTHCOM , says around 90 aid flights a day are landing at Port-au-Prince 's airport . At present , there are 4,200 US military personnel in Haiti , or are involved in the relief effort , and thousands more will arrive next week , he says . In the meantime , the US is looking at the possibility of establishing a support base in the Dominican Republic , so supplies can be brought in by land , he adds . `` If the citizens of Haiti will just remain in place and remain calm , help is on the way , '' Gen Fraser pledges . 2012 Thomas Ewald , the leader of a special US rescue unit that arrived in Haiti on Thursday , tells the Miami Herald that it is likely most of the victims will be buried in mass graves . Following lessons learned from the 2004 Asian tsunami , recovery teams will only be able to take snapshots of the dead before the bodies decay and snip pieces of clothing to show relatives .

One position that she entertains is the notion that a stalemate is tolerable , and that it might even work . A steady but relentless bombing campaign , generous humanitarian aid and training for the rebels , a bit of patience , and we re done with Gaddafi without too much fuss or boots on the ground . Western -LRB- or certainly Arab League -RRB- political leaders might not discuss Libya often these days , but a stalemated civil war there is seriously problematic for five reasons : First , people are dying and the situation could worsen . Before the civil war erupted , the chief prosecutor of the International Criminal Court , Luis Moreno-Ocampo , estimated that 500 to 700 persons had been killed in February alone when Libyan security forces had fired live ammunition . Since then , deaths overwhelmingly committed by the regime have escalated though leveled off . A Libyan rebel spokesperson estimated two weeks ago that at least 15,000 people had been killed , but reports of civilian deaths at the hands of regime forces have all but disappeared . Given the motivations for revenge among both sides , however , the lull in violence directed at civilians could be short lived . As the UN s International Commission of Inquiry on Libya concluded in its report last week , The Commission reached the conclusion that crimes against humanity and war crimes have been committed by the Government forces of Libya , and did find some acts which would constitute war crimes by opposition forces . Second , one-sixth of the Libyan population of six million has been displaced . Approximately 920,000 expatriate workers in Libya were forced to return to their home countries , with some 250,000 having since returned . Sub-Saharan African workers have been targeted by rebel forces for arbitrary search and detention , as well as cruel and inhuman mistreatment . As the International Commission of Inquiry report revealed : The most serious attacks on migrant workers appear to have been linked to a suspicion that such persons were mercenaries on the basis of their national origin or skin color . According to UNHCR , at least another 100,000 people are believed to be internally displaced , though few aid agencies have a good picture of the situation in the Nafusa Mountains . Third , humanitarian assistance is needed . Applebaum identifies generous humanitarian aid as one precondition for stalemate giving way to success . However , the international community has not been generous so far . The UN issued its latest appeal for $ 407 million of critically needed humanitarian aid three weeks ago . As of today , all of the UN aid agencies in Libya have received less than half of the required funding in the form of either actual cash or pledges . In much of the eastern part of the country , the aid situation has stabilized and commercial markets are functioning . Nevertheless , as a UNHCR spokesperson stated today : An aid crisis could be looming It is apparent that the combined impact of protracted conflict and sanctions are eroding the government s ability to effectively deliver assistance . Fuel shortages are compounding the worsening humanitarian situation throughout the country . At one gas station in Tripoli , the lines stretched over five miles . Fourth , most children are not attending school . The National Transitional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- refuses to reopen schools . Education officials from the NTC have said that schools will only reopen once Gadhafi has fallen , the curriculum is rewritten , and teachers sympathetic to the regime have been purged . In the meantime , the NTC has put children to work cleaning streets , working as traffic cops and dishing up army rations to rebel soldiers , according to Dawn newspaper . Meanwhile , the UN s International Commission of Inquiry reports that both government and opposition forces have used child soldiers in violation of international humanitarian law . Finally , history and vast amounts of academic research demonstrate that the political upheaval caused by sustained civil wars decreases almost all socio-economic indicators , makes the eruption of post-conflict violence -LRB- including genocide and mass atrocities -RRB- much more likely , and often produces violence for export . On the latter point , some officials , such as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton , believe that Libya could become a breeding ground for Al Qaeda . As she testified before Congress in early March : Many of the Al Qaeda activists in Afghanistan and later in Iraq came from Libya and came from eastern Libya , which is now the so-called free area of Libya One of our biggest concerns is Libya descending into chaos and becoming a giant Somalia . The possibility of Al Qaeda or its affiliates establishing a foothold in Libya has been overblown . -LRB- One of the NTC s unbelievably one-sided public opinion polls asked Does Al Qaeda play a role in the 17th February Revolution ? Allegedly , 94 percent of respondents said no. -RRB- Nevertheless , as the civil war stalemate persists , more and more young men learn the lethal tactics of warfare , forge ties with other fighters , and perhaps develop ambitions that can only be achieved through terrorism or violent goals beyond liberating Tripoli .

The reasons you listed are just common symptoms of civil war . You could have just said : `` No civil war is tolerable '' . June 8 , 2011 at 5:31 pm | Reply There wo n't be a stalemate . Do n't you see what NATO is doing in Libya ? It 's shelling the country day in and day out ! Jet fighters and drones dash through the sky . Attack helicopters circle over Tripoli like annoying flies . The western forces led by France and Britain want to oust Gaddafi . The UN Resolution 1973 is no licence to kill him , however stubborn he is . All these sorties are a cheap solution to resolve a conflict . They might eventually lead to a military victory , yet spark moral disdain for France and Britain . June 8 , 2011 at 6:30 pm | Reply Gaddafi would have resolved this conflict within a couple of months and got rid of these barbaric idiots without NATO getting involved and killing thousands of innocent Libyan people , destroying their country and causing horrific trauma to innocent children for the rest of their lives , not to mention the horrific cancers and birth defects the radiation from thier bombs will cause from many years to come , Clinton , Obama , Sarkozy and Cameron should be publicly stoned to death for this June 8 , 2011 at 11:07 pm | Reply Thank you , Gi Gi Aldred .

June 9 , 2011 at 12:06 pm | i totally agree with you since these people are n't ready to listen to themselves . it 's all about power madness and kaddhafi is not a match . June 9 , 2011 at 12:09 pm | Sorry , but I disagree overall . The bottom line , is that the world is better off without Gaddafi around . There is usually a price to pay for a long-term solution . Any civilian casualties are , obviously , tragic . However , I have been to LIbya twice . This is a country that has been run in a mafia-like fashion for 40 + years . A very depressing place . People in that country had no chance at freedom or any real life with `` The Leader '' in power and hoarding the fruits of the country for himself . Everything comes with a price . Many US citizens died in our country 's original push for freedom as well . Why should we not lend our support -LRB- which is minimal at the time -RRB- for these people in their quest ... ? June 9 , 2011 at 1:30 pm | You are so completely wrong , I do n't even know where to begin ! You seem to conveniently leave out the bit where Gaddafi mowing these people down with helicopter gunships while they were still unarmed protesters .

As such , he became a punching bag for criticism of the aggressive Obama strategy to rescue the economy , with some critics even demanding his resignation . But at the start of 2011 , the economy disaster was averted and many of Obama 's top economic hands had departed while Geither , ironically , remained . As Treasury secretary , Geithner allocated the remaining $ 350 billion of the giant financial rescue package known as TARP green-lighted by Congress just days before Obama 's inauguration . He decided which banks and other financial companies to rescue and which to ignore and what conditions the government would attach to the rescue money . Geithner also played a significant role in shaping the administration 's $ 787 billion economic stimulus package , enacted in February 2009 . And he played a lead role in shaping the Dodd-Frank the July 2010 financial regulation overhaul package . As president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 2003 to 2009 , Geithner was one of the lead architects of the government response to the 2008-2009 crisis . It was his decision , along with those of Bush Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson and Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke , to bail out Bear Stearns in March 2008 , to let Lehman Brothers fail in September of that year , and for the government to take over insurance company American International Group . Before any of that , Geithner was a top Treasury Department official in the Clinton years , dealing with the international financial crises of 1995 to 1998 . He was a protege of Clinton administration Treasury Secretaries Robert Rubin and , especially , Larry Summers . Summers was the other leading candidate to be Obama 's Treasury secretary and instead served as a top White House economic adviser . After a flap about delinquent tax payments , the Senate confirmed Geithner , 60 to 34 , on Jan. 26 , 2009 . Amid all the gloom-and-doom , there was one piece of lighthearted news for the fledgling secretary in April 2009 when he was named to People 's annual list of the `` 100 Most Beautiful People . '' News From Around The Web WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner says the government has begun borrowing from the federal employee pension fund to keep operating without surpassing its debt limit . WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is telling congressional leaders that the U.S. government will exhaust its borrowing limit as soon as mid-February , earlier than expected . WASHINGTON -- Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner is telling congressional leaders that the U.S. government will exhaust its borrowing limit as soon as mid-February , earlier than expected . News From Around The Web WASHINGTON -- Interior Secretary Ken Salazar will leave the Obama administration in March , an Obama administration official said Wednesday . Career History : President and CEO , Federal Reserve Bank of New York ; Vice Chairman , Federal Open Market Committee -LRB- Nov. 2003 to Jan. 2009 -RRB- ; Director , Policy Development and Review , International Monetary Fund -LRB- Sept. 2001 to Nov. 2003 -RRB- Alma Mater : Dartmouth College , Bachelor 's Degree , 1983 ; Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies , Master 's , 1985 Geithner was born in New York City in 1961 , but he spent most of his youth abroad , living with his family in a variety of countries including India , Thailand , and what is now Zimbabwe . His nomadic childhood inspired an interest in language and culture . An amateur photographer , his travels allowed him to capture unique subjects . While living in Thailand , he took photographs of refugees and `` turned our bathroom in Bangkok into a darkroom , '' his mother has said . Geithner went from Dartmouth to the Johns Hopkins School for Advanced International Studies , where he received a master 's in international economics and East Asian studies in 1985 . Geithner was then hired at Kissinger Associates , the prominent international and business consulting firm founded by former Secretary of State Henry Kissinger . In 1988 , Geithner joined the Treasury Department as a career civil servant , working on issues involving Japan as a special assistant to an undersecretary . He worked there through the George H.W. Bush administration and into the Clinton years , when then-Under Secretary Summers was deeply impressed by the young staffer who had the same intellectual intensity as Summers . But Geithner had a more affable manner than the often brusque Harvard economist . `` In Geithner , Summers recognized the perfect complement , '' The New Republic reported . Indeed , Geithner was one of the few officials who had the brains and self-confidence to stand up to Summers in internal debates . `` He 's the only guy that would walk in and say , ` on this one , Larry , you 're full of it , ' '' Summers said . Summers promoted Geithner to be a deputy assistant secretary in 1994 , and later to assistant secretary and then under secretary for international affairs . In those jobs , Geithner helped manage the Treasury 's response to the Meixcan peso crisis in 1995 , the East Asian crises of 1997-1998 , and the Russian debt default in 1998 and near-collapse of the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management . Geithner was the first career civil servant to serve as a Treasury under secretary . At the end of the Clinton administration , Geithner moved to the International Monetary Fund , where he was director of policy development . That period led to a blot on his personal record . The IMF does n't pay the employer match on Social Security and Medicare taxes , meaning Geithner was responsible for paying those taxes himself . He did n't do so , however , until he was audited in 2005 , and even then only paid the back taxes for 2003 and 2004 . Geithner did n't pay the back taxes for 2001 and 2002 until after Obama tapped him to be Treasury secretary at the end of 2008 . Federal Reserve Bank of New York In 2003 , after a long search , Geithner was named president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York . In that job , he was the Fed 's eyes and ears on Wall Street , the primary regulator of some of the largest U.S. banks , and one of its lead crisis managers . In the years before the financial crisis began in 2007 , Geithner delivered many speeches discussing weaknesses in the financial regulatory system , especially frailties in the market for credit default swaps and other over-the-counter derivatives . Those warnings turned out to be prescient , as those markets contributed to the deep crisis underway . However , Geithner 's speeches often argued that as a whole the financial system was becoming more stable , and he did not take aggressive action to rein in the risk-taking of Wall Street firms . In August 2008 , financial markets began a wrenching crisis as losses mounted on securities tied to subprime mortgage loans . The crisis had spread to all types of credit products , with transactions freezing up , financial instiutions incurring huge losses and lending drying up throughout the economy . As chairman of the New York Fed , Geithner was a lead architect of the government 's response , including a campaign of interest rate cuts starting in September 2007 that pushed the federal funds rate to near zero by December 2008 . In internal Fed debates , Geithner reliably pushed for more active intervention to guard the economy than did some of his colleagues further from Wall Street . He negotiated the deal to sell failed investment bank Bear Stearns to J.P. Morgan Chase in March 2008 , ultimately putting $ 29 billion of Fed assets at risk to get the deal done . Six months later , when Lehman Brothers was on the verge of failure , Geithner was more open to saving it than Bush Treasury Secretary Paulson , but Paulson 's hardline position prevailed and it went under . Just days later , Geithner engineered the takeover of AIG , the single largest of the government bailouts so far . In February 2009 , Geithner announced his first initiative in stabilizing the financial system . Called the Financial Stability Plan , Geithner outlined what he would do with the $ 350 billion remaining from the TARP fund , including direct capital injections to banks .", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "Timothy Geithner was a skilled economist who served as Treasury Secretary during the Obama administration.", "prop_score_1": 0.5, "generate_explanation_1": "Timothy Geithner was a talented economist who played a crucial role in the Obama administration's efforts to address the economic crisis.

They had just returned from Mexico where the authorities said the virus had caused 152 deaths . The World Health Organisation reports a lower figure of 73 . In the United States 50 non-fatal cases have been confirmed . Worldwide there were 79 confirmed cases , including six in Canada , one in Spain and the couple in Scotland . Are you worried by swine flu ? So far the majority -LRB- 57 % -RRB- of people voting in our online poll say it 's all media hype . British nationals resident in or visiting Mexico may wish to consider whether they should remain in Mexico at this time . British Nationals should continue to follow local advice on precautions to take to avoid exposure to the influenza . Cases of swine influenza have been reported in Mexico City and a number of other locations across the country . Travellers should consult a doctor immediately if they show signs of flu-like symptoms . The Mexican Secretariat of Health has advised people to avoid large crowds , shaking hands and kissing people as a greeting . Maintaining a distance of at least six feet from other persons and frequent hand washing may decrease the risk of exposure . The Mexicans have closed educational establishments across the country .

See the Crime Section of this advice for more details . The Guardian 's political editor , Patrick Wintour , explains how Britain is preparing for an outbreak of swine flu . `` Prepared for the Apocalypse '' , the Independent thunders this morning describing Mexico as a `` quasi-apocalyptic vision of anonymous faces shrouded in government-issued surgical masks '' . The Express offers a double page spread on `` Pandemic Pandemonium '' . `` It destroyed the Roman Empire , wiped out most of the New World and killed millions in Europe . How disease - not just Mexico 's swine fever - has shaped the planet . '' It is littered with scaremongering including : `` Around a third of all humans could easily die off '' and `` The viruses killed the young and healthy '' and also runs a handy sidebar on `` why facemasks could be useless '' . The Telegraph reports , somewhat alarmingly , that online demand for Tamiflu is up 1000 % , with pharmacists warning that their stocks may not last . The Mail leads its story by saying that Britain can not hope to escape a `` global pandemic of swine flu '' , citing the UK 's chief medical officer saying cases here were inevitable . The Mirror , by comparison , places the ugliest picture of a pig it can find on its front page announcing `` SWINE FLU IS HERE '' focusing on the two cases of the disease confirmed in Scotland but again goes for the full throttle on its leader page : `` Sore throat at breakfast ... dead by teatime ... how the last flu pandemic killed 40 million . '' Back to the real world , and an important point noted in a few of the papers today : all those who have shown symptoms of swine flu outside Mexico so far have recovered . Things could change at any moment . But more worrisome is the corrosive and contagious quality of the fear , not the flu . And frankly the economic impact of this outbreak has the potential to be even more painful and long-lasting for all of us . Yet the panicky atmosphere in Mexico City is palpably toxic . So I 'm heading out of town for a few days -- before they really do shut down the metro . School is canceled and most ` fun ' things are closed .

Why is swine flu causing death in Mexico but not elsewhere ? The Mexican paper La Jornada says the answer is simple : `` The inevitable contrast between the deaths in Mexico and the cases caused by the virus in the United States , which seem to be much more benign , has an equally inevitable explanation : poverty . '' My Spanish-speaking colleague , Robert White , says the paper castigates successive governments for pursuing neoliberal policies of `` trimming the state '' . La Jornada says this ensured that the long-awaited announcement of such a flu outbreak was always `` bound to be disastrous '' and fatal for many of those infected . At a press conference in Poland , Gordon Brown said he would be attending a meeting of the civil emergencies committee known as Cobra to discuss the swine flu crisis when he returned to London later this morning . Brown also said that one of the patients in a Scottish hospital with swine flu was expected to go home today . `` I understand the very real concern that people across Britain , across Europe and across the world have about this outbreak of swine flu disease , '' he said . British holiday tour companies Thomson and First Choice have suspended their operations to Mexico today . Gregory Hartl , a spokesman for the WHO , told a news conference in Geneva that the WHO emergency committee will not be meeting today . Yesterday the committee recommended raising the pandemic threat level . Hartl said the WHO does not recommend travel restrictions or border closures due to swine flu . A journalist complains that it has been impossible to reach WHO officials . Hartl admits that he has 2,800 unanswered calls . On reports of new suspected cases in China , Hartl said : `` We have rumors all the time . It 's important that we hear rumors , they may turn out to be unfounded . '' As Hartl spoke , Reuters reported confirmed cases in New Zealand and Israel . `` We do n't understand why the disease has been more severe in Mexico , '' Hartl said . `` Mexico has large supplies of Tamiflu . People at the beginning of an outbreak are always more vulnerable .

Robert White has translated some more from Spanish-language media .

Now , in this first detailed account , he reveals how the CIA plotted to use a UN weapons inspection to overthrow the Iraqi regime - and how fiasco turned to tragedy when it failed ` This is big , Scott , '' Moshe Ponkovsky said . `` We do n't share this with anyone . '' Israel 's military intelligence was already assisting us at Unscom -LRB- the United Nations Special Commission , which ran the UN 's weapons inspections program in Iraq -RRB- by scrutinising the `` take '' from the American U-2 spy-plane flights over Iraq . It had proved an unorthodox but fruitful relationship for Unscom : the Israeli analysts had proved far superior to the CIA 's . But what I was now proposing to the Israelis was a dramatic expansion of this intelligence-sharing . I was asking Lieutenant Colonel Ponkovsky and his colleagues to accept tapes from a secret Unscom-British communications eavesdropping operation that we were planning in Baghdad itself . The Israelis would process the data -LRB- ie , break any codes or ciphers the Iraqis might be using , and translate -RRB- , and analyze them to determine if there was anything useful for Unscom 's mandate of disarming Iraq . It was an ambitious , and possibly dangerous , project , but I had the backing of Unscom 's senior executives - its chairman , the Swedish diplomat Rolf Ekus , his American deputy , state department official Charles Duelfer , and Russian arms control expert Nikita Smidovich . By the end of January 1996 , the scheme was falling into place : Ponkovsky told me that his boss , director of military intelligence General Ya'alon , had given authorisation . Just one part of the jigsaw puzzle was missing : with Britain providing the intercept team , and Israel doing the analysis , that just left the Americans . Earlier that month , Duelfer had handed me a paper from the CIA containing a series of questions about Unscom 's communications intercept plan . Until then , the CIA had been disdainful of Unscom as a tool for intelligence-gathering , but now they were getting interested . Not that I knew it at the time , but the hidden agenda was regime change . Steve Richter , the head of the CIA 's Near East Division , had decided that the CIA would extend a helping hand - as long as they could exploit Unscom 's work to further its plans for a coup against Saddam Hussein . This newfound enthusiasm for Unscom was only confirmed when the CIA saw how weapons inspectors were increasingly gaining access to some of the most sensitive sites in Iraq , including bases belonging to the Special Republican Guard - Saddam 's personal bodyguard . The CIA coup plan went like this : if Unscom inspections could somehow be used to trigger a crisis , that would create a pretext for a US military attack against the Special Republican Guard , then Saddam 's personal security force could be decapitated . This would clear the way for the plotters , led by Mohammad Abdullah al-Shawani , a former commander of Iraqi Special Forces who had defected to Amman in Jordan and been recruited by the CIA , to make their move . But I had no idea of the CIA 's ulterior motives for offering assistance when , on February 4 1996 , I greeted the British eavesdropping team as they arrived at Washington 's Dulles Airport to receive training and equipment from the CIA . The five intercept operators , led by Gary , a short , fit man in his early 30s , would become known as the `` Special Collection Element '' -LRB- SCE -RRB- . The Brits proved to be fast learners , and I was back in northern Virginia by mid-February , checking up on the preparation of the SCE team before escorting them to Bahrain and on to Baghdad . The Iraqis , meanwhile , were well aware of the potential intelligence value of the access gained by the weapons inspectors . The Iraqi secret service , the Mukhabarat , already maintained a unit dedicated to Unscom . The Mukhabarat 's priority was to get sanctions lifted - Iraq 's number one national security priority . Its director had been told by Saddam Hussein himself that Iraq had disarmed , and no longer had any interest in developing any WMD capability . But sanctions could not be lifted until Unscom inspectors reached that conclusion for themselves . So the Mukhabarat 's objective was not to obstruct our work ; quite the reverse , they had an interest in getting the Iraqi experts who were our counterparts to cooperate . Their problem was that these officials were petrified of the Special Security Organisation , run by Saddam 's son Qusay Hussein . If their cooperation with Unscom was seen as compromising the regime 's security , the consequences for the individuals involved would have been brutal . Because they regarded such locations as Special Republican Guard units as off-limits , the Special Security Organisation demanded early warning of any inspection effort targeting presidential security . As a consequence , the Mukhabarat redoubled its efforts to penetrate Unscom - with outstanding success . First , electronic surveillance of our computers in Baghdad , Bahrain and New York was established . Then , with French technical assistance provided via the French economic liaison in Baghdad - whether by rogue element , or with official permission is still unknown - the Mukhabarat broke Unscom 's encryption system , so they could listen in on all `` secure '' phone calls between Baghdad and New York . With their advance knowledge of Unscom 's plans , the Iraqis were able to pre-empt inspections at will . By June 1996 , a new inspection , Unscom 150 , was getting under way . The aim was to shed light on the Iraqi mechanism of concealment - specifically the role of the Special Security Organisation . The paramilitary wing of the CIA was taking an extraordinary interest in Unscom 150 . A man I knew as Moe Dobbs , a former American weapons inspector who was in fact a senior officer in the CIA 's covert operations Special Activities Staff -LRB- SAS -RRB- , had assigned three men to provide logistics and communications support for the team . In retrospect this was suspicious , but at the time I was just grateful to get the help we so badly needed . Smidovich and I put together an inspection plan , which had us `` squeezing '' Special Republican Guard facilities in the Baghdad area . With Israeli help , I had found the location of every Special Republican Guard unit around the capital . Strangely , Dobbs and the SAS objected to one of these targets - a barracks belonging to the 3rd Battalion of the 1st Brigade . `` There 's nothing there , '' Dobbs said . `` We 've checked it out . '' We dropped it from our list . While we were busy planning our inspection , the CIA 's Iraq Operations Group had dispatched a special team of agents to its Amman Station to coordinate coup planning with the Iraqi National Accord -LRB- INA -RRB- , a group of Iraqi expatriates led by a former Ba'athist official , Iyad Alawi , whom Richter had brought together with al-Shawani . The White House was under political pressure to be seen to be doing something about Iraq . When the CIA said they had a plan - the `` Silver Bullet '' coup - to get rid of Saddam Hussein , the White House approved it . Of course , there was a political dimension : the upcoming presidential elections in November 1996 . Tony Lake , the national security adviser to President Clinton , was sensitive to any possibility of an `` October Surprise '' and , in private discussions with CIA director John Deutch -LRB- denied by both Deutch and Lake , but acknowledged by many CIA insiders -RRB- , ordered that the coup be wrapped up by early summer . The only problem was that this coup , supposedly planned in great secrecy , was well known to the Iraqi government . Many of the defectors being used by the CIA were actually Mukhabarat double agents . Then , through a series of tragic mistakes , the Mukhabarat took control of one of the CIA 's secure satellite communications units used by the INA to communicate with the plotters in Baghdad . So the Mukhabarat learned every detail of the plan - including the fact that the CIA was linking the timing of the coup with the Unscom inspection in early June", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "Scott Ritter was the former US marine captain tasked with finding Saddam Hussein's weapons.

For months , rebel fighters -- who have controlled the eastern city of Benghazi and other areas -- have been trying to move closer toward Tripoli , in the west . They are seeking the ouster of Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi , who has ruled Libya for 42 years . International leaders have accused Gadhafi 's regime of committing human rights violations and killing civilians . Libyan officials have repeatedly accused NATO of killing civilians in airstrikes . Here are some key points CNN has reported in the conflict . Three days after the fall of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , calls go out on Facebook for peaceful demonstrations in Libya against leader Moammar Gadhafi . The Libyan leader , who has ruled over the country for more than four decades , voiced support for Mubarak during the Egyptian crisis . About 200 demonstrators protesting the arrest of a human activist take to the streets in the coastal city of Benghazi , witnesses say . Several of them are arrested amid confrontations with police . A highly placed source close to the Libyan government tells CNN , `` There is nothing serious here . These are just young people fighting each other . '' Libyan state television shows images of men chanting pro-Gadhafi slogans , waving flags and singing around the Libyan leader 's limousine as it creeps through Tripoli . In Benghazi , human rights groups and protesters claim they 're under attack by pro-government security forces . Among the tens of thousands of protesters who take to the streets , at least 20 people are killed and 200 are wounded , according to medical sources . Protests continue to turn violent , however the death and injury toll is unclear . In Benghazi , witnesses report bloody clashes with soldiers firing tear gas and bullets . Witnesses say protests have erupted in cities across the country . Human Rights Watch reports that 84 people have been killed in Libyan demonstrations since February 15 . Violence surges in Benghazi where a witness says protesters have taken control of the city and much of Tripoli . Gadhafi 's son Saif al-Islam Gadhafi appears on state television to warn demonstrators that the country could fall into civil war if their protests do not subside . The Libyan newspaper Quryna reports that the country 's justice minister has resigned to protest what he calls a `` bloody situation and use of excessive force '' by security forces against protesters . Gadhafi appears on television to dispel rumors that he has fled the country , vowing he will never leave Libya , and `` will die as a martyr at the end . '' The United Nations Security Council issues a statement saying it `` condemned the violence and use of force against civilians , deplored the repression against peaceful demonstrators and expressed deep regret at the deaths of hundreds of civilians '' in Libya . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon condemns what he calls `` egregious violations '' of human rights as Libya tries to crush an ongoing revolt , telling reporters that those who have shed `` the blood of innocents '' must face punishment . U.S. President Barack Obama signs an executive order freezing Moammar Gadhafi 's assets . The United Nations Security Council imposes sanctions against Libya , including an arms embargo , asset freeze and travel bans for Gadhafi and his associates . It also refers Gadhafi to the International Criminal Court for alleged crimes against humanity . The opposition movement announces that it has picked a leader : former Justice Minister Mustafa Abdul Jalil . The European Union bans the sale of arms and ammunition to Libya and freezes the assets of Gadhafi and five members of his family , while imposing a visa ban on Gadhafi and 15 other people tied to the regime 's crackdown . The United Nations General Assembly adopts a resolution to oust Libya from its seat on the 47-member Human Rights Council . NATO begins round-the-clock surveillance flights of Libya as it considers various options for dealing with escalating violence there . The United Nations Security Council votes to impose a no-fly zone over Libya and take `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians . The resolution is approved with 10 votes , including those of the United States and the United Kingdom . There are no opposing votes on the 15-member council , but China , Russia , Germany , India and Brazil abstain . Germany says it is concerned about a protracted military conflict . Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa says the country has decided on `` an immediate cease-fire and the stoppage of all military operations . '' But sources inside Libya say violence continues . French , British and American military forces begin the first phase of operation `` Odyssey Dawn , '' aimed at enforcing the no-fly zone . More than 110 Tomahawk missiles fired from American and British ships and submarines hit about 20 Libyan air and missile defense targets , U.S. Vice Adm. William Gortney says at a Pentagon briefing . The operation is meant `` to deny the Libyan regime from using force against its own people , '' Gortney says . Gadhafi , speaking on Libyan state TV , says the U.N. charter provides for Libya 's right to defend itself in a `` war zone . '' Weapons depots will be opened , he says . `` All you people of the Islamic nations and Africa , and Latin America and Asia , stand with the Libyan people in its fight against this aggression , '' Gadhafi said . NATO agrees to take command of the mission enforcing a no-fly zone over Libya . A Libyan woman with bruises all over her body bursts into a Tripoli hotel housing international journalists , shouting that she was taken from a checkpoint and held for two days while 15 of Gadhafi 's militiamen beat and raped her . `` Look at what Gadhafi 's brigades did to me , '' Eman al-Obeidy says before government officials and hotel staff whisk her outside to car and drive her away . She is not heard from for more than a week . The Libyan government says al-Obeidy is mentally ill and drunk . Officials call her a prostitute . Later , the government changes its story and says the men accused of raping al-Obeidy are being investigated , but the suspects , in turn , file counter-charges for slander . Libyan Foreign Minister Moussa Koussa arrives in the United Kingdom and tells the government there that he has resigned . NATO announces that it has begun Operation Unified Protector in Libya , including an arms embargo , a no-fly zone , and `` actions to protect civilians and civilian centers . '' Gadhafi urges U.S. President Barack Obama to end the NATO bombing of his war-torn country , making an appeal in a letter to the American president . Gadhafi asks Obama to stop what he calls the `` unjust war against a small people of a developing country , '' adding that those in the opposition are terrorists and members of al Qaeda , the official said . In a speech , Gadhafi urges NATO to negotiate an end to airstrikes , accusing the international coalition of killing civilians and destroying the nation 's infrastructure in a bid to take over its oil production . NATO launches a missile attack on a house in Tripoli . The attack kills one of Gadhafi 's sons , Saif al-Arab Gadhafi , and several of his grandchildren . Al-Obeidy , who garnered worldwide attention for her vocal rape allegations against Gadhafi 's regime , says she has fled Libya , fearing for her safety . She tells CNN that she has crossed into Tunisia with the help of a defecting military officer and his family .

And I guess mistrust of government , another conservative article of `` faith '' , has turned out to be one of those morally relative judgments now that private financial institutions need bailing out . And I guess the basic religious and spiritual notions of accountability and taking responsibility have been annulled with regard to financial leaders and their institutions that need to be `` saved '' . And clearly the core obligations the powerful and affluent have to care for the vulnerable and poor are secondary to the `` commandment '' to rescue the wealthy . And there are the people who have been at the heart of the crisis - the people whose greed has led to the collapse of the financial system and the unprecedented collapse in the middle class and the middle and middle class . Anytime a society has millions of people lose their homes and jobs , major institutions disappear over night , and its citizens experience unprecedented levels of insecurity , uncertainty , and anxiety about the future there is a moral issue with moral implications . Of course , the first round of reaction we can expect is the typical low-level blame game between Republicans and Democrats , liberals and conservatives , free market economists and interventionists , supply-siders and Keynesians , and the poor and middle and wealthy classes . But no great moral or spiritual insight is required to know that the moral failure that has led to our present crisis is as old as human beings - in a word GREED and it would be far too easy for any `` us '' to simply blame some other `` them '' and thereby deflect and project our responsibility on someone else . And there are many of `` us '' . There are the hundred or so people at the head of each of these `` stalwart '' financial institutions whose greed led to decisions all along the way which destroyed their institutions . There are the brilliant and innovative financiers , who developed incredibly complex investment vehicles which were supposed to spread risk , whose greed actually blinded them to risk as they and their investors `` earned '' ungodly sums of money . There are the politicians on both sides of the aisle who failed in their roles as servants , representatives , and protectors of the people whose greed to maintain their power kept them from telling their constituents the truth that not everyone can own a home and limited their ability to tell their powerful supporters that regulations that had been gutted under President Clinton were indeed needed . There are the nine federal agencies responsible for overseeing some part of the mortgage market and there are the real estate brokers whose greed inspired them to break every `` rule '' in seducing people with mortgages that were beyond buyer 's means . And then there is us : regular Main Street American home owners whose greed compelled us to take on mortgages -LRB- or second mortgages -RRB- that we knew were too good to be true in order to support consumption well beyond our means . Every religious and spiritual wisdom tradition suggests that great moments of collective trauma or suffering are also invitations - not for flight -LRB- turning inwards to simply protect ourselves -RRB- or fight -LRB- blaming others -RRB- - but to honestly self-reflect , introspect , and grow . Obviously , some people are guiltier than others for this economic crisis but in an interdependent reality all are responsible . From a religious or psycho-spiritual perspective we begin a genuine and healthy process of reconstruction and renewal when each of us , wherever we are on the continuum of `` power '' and `` influence '' is prepared to ask : What did I do that may have contributed to where we collectively find ourselves ? What personal responsibility do I have for what is happening ? In what ways did I buy into an economic model completely built upon greater and greater consumption - a system in which our ever expanding desires far too easily are turned into needs ? How has my understanding of happiness and success -LRB- getting , amassing , having , and consuming more and more -RRB- distorted my values and fed my greed ? How much did I hide myself from the truth I knew deep down - that something was wrong as there is no easy credit in life : credit needs to be merited earned . Yes , there has been serious moral failure that has led to this economic wreckage and moral failure requires accountability . Accountability begins with ourselves and then and only then can legitimately be extended outwards to those who do in fact carry greater responsibility . So let 's start to rebuild our social contract which has been eroded by the age old vice of greed . Not by descending into a blame game but by each of us seriously asking ourselves three simple moral questions : What did I do to help get us to this place ? What do I need to change with regard to my own behavior ? What can I do to help the most vulnerable of my fellow citizens - those who more hurt and vulnerable than I am - and there is always someone more vulnerable than we are ? -LRB- For those who enjoy a Biblical reference : Where are you ? and Where is your brother ? -RRB- And let 's stop having faith in the economy and begin to have faith in each other - trusting that the happiness that comes from greed is transient at best while the happiness that comes from giving , serving and even sacrificing for each other is far more enduring and credit-worthy . The reason why we are in this FINANCIAL MESS is because all those holes came into play at full throttle . Some people simply abused the weakness of the dollar for their benefit . Upon seeing the weakness of the dollar , they played up the price of oil . They can do it because as we have seen last Monday , there is no regulation that can stop them from doing so . With very high oil prices , the companies become vulnerable and weak . Here comes the SHORT SELLERS taking advantage of that weakness and betted that the stock prices of these companies would fail . As a result of stocks plunging , many companies struggled and many could have borrowed money from banks and in the process raised the interest rates . Also , profits from short selling contribute to excess liquidity and to offset this liquidity , interest rates are raised . As interest rates climbed , so does the mortgage interest rates . Many homeowners defaulted which put banks on a tough situation . Again the SHORT SELLERS saw the opportunity to profit so they came BETTING AGAINST the banks until we see all these big banks failed . Now , we can see that there are THREE BIG SUCKING HOLES that came into play that put us into this mess . The FIRST are the SPECULATORS who played up THE PRICE OF OIL . The SECOND are SHORT SELLERS which pulled down the stock market . The resulting HOLE -LRB- third hole -RRB- which these two sucking holes created are the FORECLOSED houses which continue to burden the financial system . The SOLUTION to this mess is simply to PLUG UP these THREE HOLES . First is to create an OIL PRICE STABILIZATION LAW which I explained in my earlier posts . Second is to PERMANENTLY BAN SHORT SELLERS . Thirdly , if they want a bailout , it should be used to relieve the homeowners by lowering their mortgage interest payments and return the foreclosed houses to its previous owners under a restructured payment scheme that 's affordable . The third solution will release the banks from bad debt and can therefore continue and start clean anew . The hedgefunds which will be affected by the ban on short selling can look for MORE PRODUCTIVE investments like the manufacturing sectors and new technologies sectors . This shift of investment would lower interest rates because manufacturers would not be crowding in the banks for loans . This will also make our manufacturing sectors competitive . As a result more jobs will be created .

The eight M16 officers and SAS soldiers were arrested then deported after only two days in the country . They were later released , but were not allowed to leave the country . How could that happen to a British delegation that was trying to help ? Hague 's statement at the Commons created more questions than answers . He said : On 5 March opposition groups in the East formed an Interim National Council based in Benghazi . Ministers and FCO -LRB- Foreign and Commonwealth Office -RRB- officials are in contact with members of this Council , who welcomed the idea of a British diplomatic mission to Libya ... Last week I authorised the despatch of a small British diplomatic team to Eastern Libya , in uncertain circumstances which we judged required their protection , to build on these initial contacts and to assess the scope for closer diplomatic dialogue . I pay tribute to that team . They were withdrawn yesterday after a serious misunderstanding about their role leading to their temporary detention . The British opposition smells blood . Shadow Foreign Secretary , Douglas Alexander is accusing the government of `` serial bungling , '' saying that `` The British public are entitled to wonder whether , if some new neighbors moved into the Foreign Secretary 's street , he would introduce himself by ringing the doorbell or instead choose to climb over the fence in the middle of the night ? '' Menzies Campbell , a former opposition leader from the Liberal Democrats , called the mission `` ill-conceived , poorly planned and embarrassingly executed . '' But that 's just rhetoric at the Commons . It 's part of the usual thrust and parry of British politics , and it 's internal . The real embarrassment for Britain was played out across TV screens in Tripoli . Here 's what happened : 10 Downing Street 's man in Libya was called in to explain what the `` diplomats '' were doing in eastern Libya . British Ambassador Richard Northern spoke to a rebel leader to explain the mission . And , you guessed it , the call was intercepted by Gadhafi 's regime and duly found its way to Libyan state television on Sunday . Now all of Libya will have a very different take on James Bond . The whole fiasco makes it ever more important for countries to think very carefully before they engage with Libya . There 's also the question of who you 're dealing with in Libya -- Gadhafi himself , or the varied opposition groups that are rising up in arms ? And how will they respond ? As U.S. Defense Secretary Gates testified at a House hearing last week , discussing no-fly zones without fully understanding the repercussions is just '' loose talk . '' The British military like ours have absolutely no business in Libya except for humanitarian purposes . We need to stay out of Libya 's civil war and stop instigating the insurrection there and let the chips fall where they may . March 7 , 2011 at 9:29 pm | Reply Actually , I believe you will find that as fighting began to break out it was the Royal Navy -LRB- part of the British military -RRB- Which rescued Us citizens living in Libya , as well as British , French and other foreign nationals , or do you think the UK left US citizens to become collateral damage ? Of course it might be the ` business ' of a different country to rescue our people ? March 9 , 2011 at 6:19 pm | Reply Who can rule out Al Quida , Jehad or other Muslim Fundamentalists behind Libya Freedom Fighters Movement ? col Gadhafi was fighting against those forces otherwise Libya already may be Muslim fundamentalist country ! What is better for Libyan people is better for world . I think Libyan people like Gadhafi over Muslim Fundamentalist Regime . So Libyan issue is complex thing which need to handle very carefully without allowing any blood bath there . March 19 , 2011 at 12:21 pm | Reply To the Editor , CNN March 7 2011 There is an ongoing debate and Republican Party pressure on Pres. Obama to intervene militarily on the side of the Rebels in Libya . Another suggestion is to create a No-Fly zone . Defense Secretary Gates has rightly labeled this as ` Loose Talk ' . In case US acts without concurrence and active participation of the World Powers and without a UN Security Council Resolution backing such action , and if Gaddafi survives the rebellion , we will have created a problem for the world as Libya exports 12 % of the worlds petroleum exports . And our military participation on the Libyan Rebels side might create expectations in the other democratic\\/rebel movements in the Middle East . Libya is not our business plain and simple , the Libyans must engage in their own self-determination efforts as bloody as it may become . The Republicans will just need to chill on this latest opportinity to engage in war-profiteering for their favored corporate interests , our goverment needs to spend money on people , infrastructure , research and development here at home .

How can Leaders who ca n't solve domestic economic and social issues solve international complex problems ! March 19 , 2011 at 12:28 pm | March 8 , 2011 at 9:21 am | Reply The USA is still the worlds strongest economy , much like the UK before WW2 . China is growing , very strong economy , like the USA before WW2 . Before WW2 Great Britain was the worlds richest country , and spent all of its wealth -LRB- and lost its empire -RRB- during the war . The United States an upcoming great power did not get involved in the war for two years , preferring to sell arms to the UK , in order to make money . In fact it took a direct assault an US sovereign territory to provoke the nation to fight , rather than turn a profit . Asking China to get involved is ridiculous , if the USA is allowed to profit from a war -LRB- a slightly more important one in terms of human rights and world peace -RRB- , why not China ? After WW2 The United States was the only major participant to have made a profit , largely by sitting on the side and letting British , Soviet , and free European soldiers do the fighting . These days the USA posses the worlds largest armed forces and strongest national economy , like the British Empire before WW2 , why cant the USA make a stand and fight against Libya , like Britain against The third Reich , after all , Libya is n't as powerful a country as Nazi Germany was is it ? Or is the US government still afraid to fight the bad guys ? March 9 , 2011 at 6:24 pm | Reply Now that 's just BS . We saved your a $ $ es from getting kicked by the Nazis . No matter how long it took us to get into the war , its obvious that we were the ones who helped the most to end it . March 10 , 2011 at 9:13 am | Best solution is to send multinational peace keeping troups after permanent cease fire . China , Russia , India , Germany and others will support it . But UK , France & USA want to see blood in Libya like allied forces killed thousands of civilians by areial bombardments ! Civilized world should not allow this to happen again in any country . Gadhafi is Dictator but he is better than Islamic Fundamentalists . World can foce Gadhafi to go for democratic reforms which they have signalled to do in the future .

The opinions expressed are his own . A young Syrian called Ausama Monajed was on a train to London . One of his hobbies was reading e-books . On this trip , he picked Gene Sharp s From Dictatorship to Democracy , which maps out strategies for using non-violent struggle to bring down repressive regimes . Monajed , now one of the revolution s leaders outside the country , became engrossed . It was as if I was reading an exact description of Syria , Monajed told Reuters Breakingviews . The next thing he noticed was a conductor tapping him on the shoulder . The train had arrived at its terminus in Euston Station . He asked me if I wanted to return where I d come from . Sharp , who was inspired by India s Mohandas Gandhi and who himself influenced some of the activists behind the Egyptian revolution , stresses that a dictator s power isn t monolithic . It relies on the army , police , civil service , business and , indeed , the wider society just to function . Activists should therefore analyze those pillars of support and systematically undermine them . The best way to do this is not to fight dictators with their own weapons - matching violence with violence in a struggle they are likely to lose but to use non-violent tactics . It is much harder for the security forces to kill unarmed civilians than those who fire back at you . The more brutally the regime represses them , the shakier its pillars of support become . Eventually , the violence boomerangs on the regime and destroys it . Sharp makes clear that non-violent struggles normally don t succeed through spontaneous combustion . They need planning and training . Most importantly , it is vital to maintain nonviolent discipline which isn t easy when activists are being killed , tortured and detained . Monajed , now 31 , was smitten . An economist by training , he had hoped that Syria s president Bashar al-Assad would be a reformer when he succeeded his father Hafez Assad , who died in 2000 . Monajed worked for the United National Development Programme and then the European Commission on development programs inside Syria . But then he became disillusioned and joined the opposition . After being arrested several times , Monajed quit the country in 2005 and has never returned . He says he has become one of the regime s most wanted people after writing an article in the Washington Post this April . This said the U.S. government had several years ago funded Barada TV , a London-based channel beaming anti-regime programming into Syria which he had helped establish . After coming across Sharp s work , Monajed studied previous nonviolent revolutions , especially the Serbs overthrow of Slobodan Milosevic in 2000 . He went to see Sharp , now an 83-year-old academic , in Boston . He also wrote a master s degree dissertation on the role of the internet and information technology in non-violent struggle with a focus on Syria . In 2007 Monajed organized a meeting with some disaffected Syrian friends in London . He says it is too risky to reveal their names . They decided to get trained in the techniques of nonviolent struggle and use that as the basis for training others . We brought Syrians out of the country and trained them in nonviolent techniques , Monajed says . The idea was to train leaders and send them back to train others . They found it hard to recruit volunteers . They were told nonviolent struggle wouldn t work in Syria because of religious and geopolitical factors . In the end , they managed to train around 100 people . Then came the Tunisian and Egyptian revolutions . The whole Middle East was electrified . Syrians began to think they too might get their freedom . People contacted Monajed s group , saying that now they understood what it was advocating . The first protest took place on March 15 in the Hamidiyeh bazaar in the heart of old Damascus . They chose Hamidiyeh because it is a covered market . There were only about 40 protesters but their chants , calling for freedom , echoed off the iron roof making it seem like there were more . Because the bazaar was crowded , it was hard to distinguish who was a protestor and who was just an onlooker - again exaggerating their numbers . The next protests took place spontaneously in Deraa , near the border with Jordan , after 15 school children had been arrested for scrawling anti-regime graffiti on walls . These protests were much bigger , with thousands eventually taking part . The security services fired on unarmed civilians . The killing began in earnest . After that , protests started mushrooming around the country . Facebook pages were created ; people communicated via Twitter ; protesters took video clips with their mobile phones and posted them on YouTube . Everything was happening faster than Monajed and his colleagues had imagined . Most of the protests had nothing to do with them . The challenge was how to put some order into the revolution . An early priority was to set up a virtual operation center , staffed by dozens of volunteers outside the country , feeding what was happening on the ground to the world outside . Most foreign journalists were quickly kicked out of the country , including one Reuters journalist who was beaten up by the secret police , so it was important to get information out to the international media . Many of the most popular internet pages were coordinated through a new body , The Coalition of Syrian Pages . On the ground , local coordinating committees started emerging in different neighborhoods . They organize campaigns , raise money to cover living costs of the families of those who had been killed or detained , and help communicate what is happening in their area . The Coalition of Syrian Pages has gradually taken a bigger role in coordinating activity . It consists of about 20-25 people , some inside the country and some abroad . Monajed won t reveal their names . The authorities don t know who all the members of the Coalition are or where they are , he explains . One of the current priorities is to have a strategic plan that includes action on the ground and international lobbying for things like an oil embargo . This has involved coordinating the work of the activists , most of whom are young , with the traditional cohort of opposition made up of politicians , lawyers and human rights campaigners , many of whom signed the anti-regime Damascus Declaration in 2005 . Initially there wasn t a plan ; just an idea of demonstrating until the regime falls , says Monajed . Now , with the Coalition , we are trying to guide the effort in a strategic manner to knock down the -LRB- regime s -RRB- pillars of support . A particularly sensitive issue , which didn t exist in either Egypt or Tunisia , is the potential for sectarian conflict . Assad is an Alawite , a minority Shi ite Muslim sect . Many of the top positions in government , the military and business are also held by Alawites . But most of the population is Sunni Muslim . Given this background , the regime s four main pillars of support in order of importance , according to Monajed , are : the security forces including secret police ; the Alawites ; army generals , especially those who are Alawite ; and the Sunni business elite , many of whom have prospered since Assad partly liberalised the economy . In order to knock down these pillars , it is essential to keep the campaign peaceful , says Monajed . People don t want a Libyanisation of the situation , he says , referring to the civil war across the Mediterranean Sea . So demonstrators give roses to the army and don t insult them in their chants . The underlying message they are trying to send to the top generals is : We differentiate between you and the security service . Some soldiers have mutinied after being ordered to kill unarmed protesters . The message to the Alawites is that they are being held hostage by the Assad regime - and it can t be in their interests to engage in a war of elimination . The protesters have used chants stressing the unity between Sunni , Alawites and Christians -LRB- another minority -RRB- and called on Alawite and Christian generals to lead the transition to democracy .

'' So let 's try to clean this up a bit . I should warn you that this post is , by blog standards , a bit long . But I can also promise that it 's much , much shorter than Gorton 's paper . Gorton 's basic argument is actually pretty elegant . `` The period from 1934 , when deposit insurance was enacted , until the current crisis is somewhat special in that there were no systemic banking crises in the U. S , '' he writes . `` It is the ` Quiet Period . ' '' The Great Recession has been a high-decibel disruption of our happy quiescence . The question is : What changed ? What did n't change , Gorton says , is the commercial banking sector . We did not have a 1929-style bank run . Deposit insurance -- the system wherein the government insures deposits of individuals up to $ 250,000 -- worked . Individuals did not line up around the block . Rather , the entirety of the crisis was in the `` shadow banking sector . '' This is where major institutions lend to one another . It is a new , and largely unregulated , market . But , in certain important ways , it is very similar to the old banking sector . And not the banking sector we 've had since 1934 . The banking sector we had before 1934 . Fixing the shadow banking sector will , for that reason , require the application of principles that fixed the commercial banking sector in the 1930s . In other words : We 've done this before . The important parallel between the two markets is that both individual depositors plugging $ 1,000 into their bank and institutional investors looking to park $ 12 million want the same thing . They want , according to Gorton , `` informationally-insensitive debt . '' This is a key concept , so let 's spend a moment on it . Imagine you give Apple $ 1,000 for shares in its company . The next day , a rumor starts . Apple CEO Steve Jobs , it seems , has had his head amputated . He might not be back at work for three to five months . Your iPhone cries a salty , electronic tear . So does your portfolio . Apple 's stock plummets . Your $ 1,000 is now worth $ 812 . The stocks you bought from Apple were informationally-sensitive . They were vulnerable to information . You could not count on your $ 1,000 to exist come hell or high water . Imagine , now , that you deposited that $ 1,000 in the bank instead . A week later , the bank becomes insolvent . Half its employees immediately commit suicide . The other half flee the country . This is literally the worst information possible for your deposit . But it does n't matter . The government -- through the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation -- insures your money . Your $ 1,000 is perfectly safe . It was , as it turns out , information-insensitive . Large investors , Gorton argues , also want informationally-insensitive debt . They want to give a bank $ 10 million dollars , have the bank owe them $ 10 million in return and be assured that the $ 10 million is safe . But the FDIC does n't ensure deposits that large . Hence , the shadow banking market . I 'm going to glide by the details a bit , as they 're complex . His paper has a fuller explanation . But the shadow banking market , according to Gorton , works like this : A mega investor -- the `` depositor '' -- has $ 500 million he wants to deposit . Another institution -- the `` bank , '' though it does n't have to be a bank as traditionally composed -- is willing to give the depositor collateral in return . The collateral is , in most cases , a senior tranche of securitized loans -LRB- if you want a good explanation of that concept , see this paper -RRB- . Those tranches were generally considered informationally-insensitive . They were the depositor 's insurance . But there is a difference between being informationally-insensitive and being actually riskless . An individual 's $ 500 deposit is safe unless the government itself defaults . That 's pretty unlikely . The senior tranche of a pack of subprime mortgages is safe as long as housing prices keep increasing . That , as it turns out , was n't very unlikely at all . Which brings us to another key point : `` a ` banking panic ' occurs when ` informationally-insensitive ' debt becomes ` informationally-sensitive ' due to a shock , in this case the shock to subprime mortgage values due to house prices falling . '' In other words , a banking panic occurs when deposits stop looking safe . That , Gorton argues , is how it happened in the days before deposit insurance , too . Then , for some reason , they did n't seem safe because the banks seemed like they might go bust . Depositors would panic and run to get their money back before the bank folded in on itself . That would create a bank run , which would , in turn , create insolvent banks . We ended bank runs in two ways : First , deposit insurance and associated regulations made bank deposits essentially riskless . Second , we made bank charters valuable by promoting local monopolies , underpricing deposit insurance and other means . Put another way , the 75-year `` quiet period '' was a product of making deposits in commercial banks riskless for individuals and making commercial banks profitable for banks . Gorton argues that a similar approach is needed for the shadow banking sector . Toward the end of the paper , he offers a `` very broad '' sketch of what it would look like : 1 . Senior tranches of securitizations of approved asset classes should be insured by the government . The government must supervise and examine banks , i.e. , securitizations , rather than rely on ratings agencies . That is , the choices of asset class , portfolio and tranching must be overseen -LRB- by -RRB- examiners . Entry into securitization should be limited , and any firm that enters is deemed a ` bank ' and subject to supervision . It is , in other words , very much like what we did after 1934 . Examining and insuring `` senior tranches of approve assets classes '' -- insuring collateral , in other words -- is rather a lot like what the FDIC does with deposits . Limiting access of firms into the shadow market -- which would probably be referred to as the `` institutional market '' or something similarly less-sinister sounding -- is rather like what we do with commercial bank charters . This has been a bit of a long post , so I want to remind folks of the lede : I 'm not summarizing this paper because I think it 's interesting . I 'm summarizing it because Ben Bernanke is talking it up . Yesterday , Felix Salmon wrote a post asking `` what use economic history ?

Joe Lieberman , I-Connecticut , to arm rebels in Libya fighting Moammar Gadhafi . They had mixed thoughts on whether the United States should be involved in imposing a no-fly zone in that country to protect protestors from attacks by Libyan war planes . I would not suggest either of those courses for the moment , said Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana , the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee who indicated U.S. involvement could lead to war . Depending upon the method of delivery and what we decide to do we could decide to have a war in Libya to join the war in Afghanistan and Iraq . Sen. Susan Collins , R-Maine , a member of the Armed Services Committee , said she would be leery of providing arms at this point but said she supports a no-fly zone . I do believe our allies may be able to join together with us to enforce a no-fly zone over Libya to help protect the people from Gadhafi , she said . Any actions that we take I believe should be in concert with our allies . Sen. Lindsay Graham , R-South Carolina , who is also on the Armed Services Committee , credited the diplomatic efforts underway by Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and suggested the U.S. work with the United Nations to stiffen and enforce sanctions against Libya . Providing arms , I m not sure that helps us , Graham said . I don t know if you could control right now who would get the arms . What I would suggest is that we really keep implementing U.N. sanctions on the economic side , on the travel side , go after assets , Graham added . And a no fly zone would make a lot of sense to me . The three senators spoke in a Capitol hallway after a vote on the Senate floor . Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , R-Nevada , said he has asked Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell , D-Kentucky , about Lieberman 's proposal to arm the Libyan rebels in a no-fly zone . McConnell said he has asked Sen. John McCain , R-Arizona , the top Republican on the Armed Services Committee , to brief Senate Republicans at their weekly policy lunch in the Capitol Tuesday about his trip to Egypt over the weekend . Lieberman traveled to Egypt with McCain , and they appeared together on CNN Sunday . McCain supported the idea of a no-fly zone but did not say if he supports providing arms to Libyans fighting Gadhafi . A no fly zone is a UN scenario ! February 28 , 2011 09:57 pm at 9:57 pm | Liebermans take on anything in the middle east is an opinion that no one should listen to , and Bomb Bomb McCain lost all judgement and respect the day he brought the Palin Plague to the forefront . Lieberman works for another country and can not be trusted and starting another war is just another way Republicans think they can get out of creating jobs like they promised to get back in the house . February 28 , 2011 10:11 pm at 10:11 pm | What is it with Mccain and Lieberman ? We cant even afford these other two wars we are fighting , and they are ready to get neck deep in Libya ? These guys just dont get it . February 28 , 2011 10:11 pm at 10:11 pm | GOP = Greed Over People P.S. Props to CNN for the heads up on the Sojourner 's WWJC bracelet . Mine is in the mail . I hope and suggest other Christians avail themselves of the bracelets to counter the `` christian '' cons and their heresy . 787 billion tax cut for the rich and cut 61 billion from WIC and other help for the least among us ? Buy and wear a bracelet that says What Would Jesus Cut ? February 28 , 2011 10:14 pm at 10:14 pm | Why are Republicans so flakey ? Makeup your mind already . You criticize the late response by Obama and wished he had done something sooner and now You have a problem with siding with the rebels ? February 28 , 2011 10:17 pm at 10:17 pm | Apparently , the opposition has not agreed to give U.S. companies first rights on the oil . If it had , Congress would declared war by now , and U.S. troops would be ready to land . Unfortunately , we 've been there , done that with Iraq already , but do n't put it past these oligarphic puppets to do it all over again . February 28 , 2011 10:39 pm at 10:39 pm | Although the Republicans do n't know what to do , they do agree that whatever Obama is doing is bad for America and too slow and indecisive . February 28 , 2011 10:44 pm at 10:44 pm | Please let us send Obama to Libya with a one way ticket so he can harm that nation and stop pushing the US towards a second c i v i l war . February 28 , 2011 10:53 pm at 10:53 pm | I agree that we should not be arming these groups in Libya . Once their current leadership is out and new government can be looked at , then we can decide if we are to sell them weapons . February 28 , 2011 11:22 pm at 11:22 pm | February 28 , 2011 11:30 pm at 11:30 pm | At last some common sense prevails . The time has come for America and Americans to realize just like the brits had to that Gunboat diplomacy or in the US case the threat or actual execution of military intervention on whatever pretext in another sovreign nations affairs is very , very rarely justified or brings the result liked by the invader . I must also add I 'm really fed up with the likes of Lieberman and McCain jumping in to criticise the Obama administrations handling of the Libya situation , even no fly zones because the British and German SAS and Airforces respectively were still rescuing thier nations people from outlying areas who worked in the Oil fields . The kind of pre-emptive ideas of the above two and liberman sending arms risked leading to another embassy hostage crisis or other similar catastrophe . Do they also realize that tens of thousands of non Libyans of mutiple nationalities are still trying to get out and cross borders to flee from a civil war . A no fly zone might be realistically imposed thru the UN and NATO . For the US to do it alone is not good policy unless you are among many -LRB- too many -RRB- Republicans who think declaring war solves all diplomatic or revolutionary situations anywhere in the world . Keep US arms and forces out of Libya ! The US has already bankrpted itself fighting unwinable wars in Afghanistan and Iraq we certainly have no need to arm rebels in Libya who could then sell or give the arms to anyone , or start using them against the UN . March 1 , 2011 12:37 am at 12:37 am | McCain is the one making awful decisions and Lieberman with him . McCain is the one who put the curse of Palin on our nation . I seriously question his judgment on anything after choosing Palin . Karl Rove even does nasty impressions of her making fun of her stupidity . Why is it Republicans always want a military solution to everything ? I love Secretary Gates comments to the West Point cadets that any Sec of Defense who suggests military action in southeast Asia or the Mideast to the President should have his head examined . In the case of Rumsfeld , Cheney and Bush - they should be in jail for intentionally starting a fraudulent war in Iraq and breaking international war crimes law on torture . The GOP proposed budget has been criticized by multiple Republican economists as killing up to 1.1 M jobs and destroying our economic recovery and Republicans acknowledge they know that but still want to ram it through .

At home they defended civil liberties and stood up for freedom of speech . Abroad , they tolerated atrocities precisely because they did n't impinge on them . ` Our great error , ' said Auden , ` was not a false admiration for Russia but a snobbish feeling that nothing which happened in a semi-barbarous country which had experienced neither the Renaissance nor the Enlightenment could be of any importance : had any of the countries we knew personally , like France , Germany or Italy , the language of which we could speak and where we had personal friends , been one to have a successful communist revolution with the same phenomena of terror , purges , censorship etc , we would have screamed our heads off . ' To speak of the ` Auden generation ' is to perpetuate a myth of the Thirties . The majority of the population , including the majority of Labor supporters , never read an Auden poem or hitched a ride with communism . What is meant is the ` progressive ' middle-class left : publishers , authors , academics , teachers , liberal journalists , the odd lawyer and odder advocate of various forms of alternative life styles . People like me , in short . In their later years , most tried a defense which Auden was too honest , and too filled with disgust at his younger self , to advance . Our priority was fighting fascism , the excuse-making ran . We were faced with a psychopathic movement of the extreme right which was dripping in blood . It looks bad now that we went along with Stalin , but we were socialists and he called what he was doing socialism , and in any event we had other priorities . Today 's middle-class left is made up of the same types as 70 years ago . The faults of small-mindedness and self-righteousness and the virtues of instinctive suspicion of the British establishment and sympathy for the British underdog have n't changed either . The fact is that the middle-class left is made up of the same types as 70 years ago . `` The left is not the same , '' said Yusuf al-Qaradawi . When Tony Blair goes we will have the first Labor leadership election without a serious left-wing candidate . Indeed , it is impossible to imagine what a serious left-wing candidate would look like and what his or her program might be . I 'm sure that any halfway competent political philosopher could rip the assumptions of modern middle-class left-wingery apart . Why is it right to support a free market in sexual relationships but oppose free-market economics , for instance ? But his criticisms would have little impact . It 's like a religion : the contradictions are obvious to outsiders but do n't disturb the faithful . You believe when you 're in its warm embrace . Alas , I 'm out . Last week , after 44 years of regular church-going , the bell tolled , the book was closed and the candle was extinguished . The officiating bishop was Peter Wilby , a former editor of the New Statesman and a friend of long-standing , who delivered his anathema in the Guardian . The immediate heresy was a piece I 'd written about how difficult the courts made it to deport suspected Islamist terrorists . As I 'd campaigned to protect asylum seekers in the past , Wilby used the article as damning evidence of ' a rightwards lurch ' . The old bat did n't understand that genuine asylum seekers are the victims of the world 's greatest criminals - four million fled Saddam Hussein - not criminals themselves . Even if he 'd grasped that the Mail was wrong and real refugees were n't villains , I doubt it would have made a difference . My mortal sin had been to question ` harshly the motives of the anti-war movement ' , and to that I had to plead guilty . The least attractive characteristic of the middle-class left - one shared with the Thatcherites - is its refusal to accept that its opponents are sincere . The legacy of Marx and Freud allows it to dismiss criticisms as masks which hide corruption , class interests , racism , sexism - any motive can be implied except fundamental differences of principle . Wilby went through a long list of what could have motivated mine and similar ` betrayals ' . Perhaps we became right wing as we got older . Perhaps we wanted to stick our snouts into the deep troughs of the Tory press . Perhaps taking out a mortgage committed us to the capitalist system or having children encouraged petit bourgeois individualism of the most anti-social kind . Generously in light of the above charge sheet , he plumped for the conclusion that our restless minds just got bored with the ` straitjacket ' of left-wing thought . We left the slog of building a better world to the decent plodders . Generous to me , and over-generous to allegedly left-wing thought . What he and a large part of the mainstream liberal-left do n't and wo n't confront is that they have become the fellow travellers of the psychopathic far-right . Many emotions have been stirred by the grisly spectacle - anger , scorn and incredulity among them - but boredom , no , never boredom . As in the 1930s , there 's little doubt that few apart from George Galloway and others in the gruesome leadership of the anti-war movement were keen on saluting Saddam Hussein . The reason why one million people marched through London without one mounting a platform to express solidarity with the victims of fascism was that it never occurred to them that there were people in Iraq who shared their values . It felt like nit-picking to point this out at the time . Wars are usually worth opposing , especially capricious wars advocated by a slippery Prime Minister in alliance with a repellent US President . But arguments have their own dynamic . If you start by refusing to look Baathism or Islamism in the face , the logic of blaming everything on Tony Blair and George W Bush pushes you into making ever more excuses for the extreme right . Auden noticed a retreat from universal principles in the 1930s - communism was fine in ` semi-barbaric ' Russia but would have been a screaming outrage in a civilised country . He should have been alive today . With no socialism to provide international solidarity , good motives of tolerance and respect for other cultures have had the unintended consequence of leading a large part of post-modern liberal opinion into the position of 19th-century imperialists . It is presumptuous and oppressive to suggest that other cultures want the liberties we take for granted , their argument runs . So it may be , but believe that and the upshot is that democracy , feminism and human rights become good for whites but not for browns and brown-skinned people who contradict you are the tools of the neo-conservatives . On the other hand when confronted with a movement of contemporary imperialism - Islamism wants an empire from the Philippines to Gibraltar - and which is tyrannical , homophobic , misogynist , racist and homicidal to boot , they feel it is valid because it is against Western culture . It expresses its feelings in a regrettably brutal manner perhaps , but that ca n't hide its authenticity . The result of this inversion of principles has been that liberals ca n't form alliances with the victims of al-Qaeda in Afghanistan or Iraq any more than the Auden generation could form alliances with the victims of Stalinism . This is n't simply about international relations . Who is going to help the victims of religious intolerance in Britain 's immigrant communities ? Not the Liberal Democrats , who have never once offered support to liberal and democrats in Iraq . Nor an anti-war left which prefers to embrace a Muslim Association of Britain and Yusuf al-Qaradawi who believe that Muslims who freely decide to change their religion or renounce religion should be executed . If the Archbishop of Canterbury were to suggest the same treatment for renegade Christians all hell would break loose . But as the bigotry comes from ` the other ' there is silence .

Instead of doing a junk shot with gulf balls and shredded tires they were supposed to put high density and sinking geometry to clog the well . We do it a lot in Soil Science and the Dust Bowl provides insights on surface transport of particles by erosion regarding detachment , transport , and deposition . Hydrology is being curbed in the patenting affairs and technological development deeply missing now to solve simple problems like clogging a spilling well . The use of golf balls in the junk shot is a clear evidence that the experts have no handle on deep Hydrology . I am not surprised since a sort of scientific discovery in Hydrodynamics is being constantly violated by lay people as Patent Examiners , Patent Attorneys , and Scientists . Try to find any address of wick\\/wicking on Hydrology textbooks and you will see that this oil spill is something that could have been stopped on the day ONE if science were respected and honored . USPTO has near 6,000 Patent Examiners and it already confirmed that none of them is a Hydrologist ! This OIL SPILL is a consequence of a bunch of people pretending to be smart overstepping the boundaries of a classic science called HYDROLOGY . Mr. Obama assigned Dr. Regina Benjamin 42 lbs overweight to take care of your health system . A person near obese in the health system that can not help herself is going to provide Americans insights to shed weight and be healthy . This way Americans are becoming 85 % obese by 2040 . I suggested Mr. Obama to resign because my advanced breakthrough scientific discovery in Hydrodynamics is being violated by flawed patents that even do not work . Why to ignore science ? I already sent Mr. Obama 14 lettters regarding violations of Hydrology getting no reply . My doubt is if people at the White House read English or people around there do not need to care about their country outcome . Just imagine if the well could be clogged in few hours by appropriate approach making gravity pull heavy objects downward on a bubbling upward flow with variable flow velocity due to the dragging effect of well casing . The relief wells may not work as clay in the mud can only clog tiny pores but fail on cracks and fissures . What is the chance that PB hires any Soil Scientist in the technical staff ? What is the chance that BP Engineers ever learned about Soil Erosion to understand detachment , transport , and deposition of particles in a dynamic flow ? I believe this entire nightmare is preventable and consequence of a failing leadership you have . How would I stop the spill ? Easily running some trials with a visible display employing translucent 22 in pipes with similar upward flow and check the dragging effect on many particle sizes and formats . The bubbling effect should increase fall by reducing the fluid density , as well as variable radial flow velocity which is higher in the center and lower around the containment case as a stationary surface . When we start injecting the junk shot we know what to expect and change the particles sizes and formats as the velocity of spill reduces by the this downward effect from the falling particles . Lower and lower velocity suggests smaller and smaller particles until clay can be used to seal tiny pores inside the well lumen definitively . What am I charging for it ? I just want USPTO to stop violating my scientific discovery US pat . 6,766,817 with flawed patents that even do not work shamefully harming and dishonoring HYDROLOGY . I got PhD at Penn State University and Bill Clinton was the speecher of my commencement on May 10 , 1996 . CNN is controlling info by removing comments on its website . I am curious who takes advantages by this ongoing catastrophe . The Valdez was a tanker that crashed with a finite amount of oil , not comparable . The bottom line was and is BP is responsible to stop the leak in a timely manner . Three months and they are still battling this mess . They were not prepared with solutions and that 's irresponsible . The earned and deserve bad PR . Posted by GSH10 | Report as abusive Are Americans bullying BP ? Read Obama 's lips , the fish stinks from its head . I think the problem is that all the actions to date have been undertaken with the intent to save possible production from the well ; if they were really serious about stopping it they would 've blown it up the day after the rig sank -- period full stop . No phony caps or junk shots , but a straight detonation -- the physics of explosions are much better understood than the technology of deepwater robotics . Would n't be so bad if the same thing did n't happen twenty-one years ago , trying the same tricks that did n't work , for months upon months . Different company , same issue . It 's as if , 1 -RRB- they 're clueless , or 2 -RRB- they do n't care . BP has a history of playing fast and loose , paying fines as they go . Are we bullying them ? Do they deserve it ? It 's absurd for anyone to expect any amount of sympathy for a soulless corporation , when the livelihood of so many ` little people ' are completely ruined because of their -LRB- BPs -RRB- mistake . BP 's first priority is BP in this case , not anything else . When companies made mistakes , they all rushed to the site to apologise ; Hayward stated he wanted his life back . A tearful apology might have eased the American anger a little , but their behavior is less then commendable . Are Americans bullying BP ? Would it be called bullying if a man got irate because someone threw a bunch of junk in their back garden ?

The US said the raid had been a huge success , killing 1,200 insurgents . But the city 's residents said they had never seen anything like it in their longtime lives . What really happened in the siege of Falluja ? In a joint investigation for the Guardian and Channel 4 News , Iraqi doctor Ali Fadhil compiled the first independent reports from the devastated city , where he found scores of unburied corpses , rabid dogs - and a dangerously embittered population Watch an extract from the documentary It all started at my house in Baghdad . I packed my equipment , the camera and the tripod . Tariq , my friend , told me not to take it with us . `` The fighters might search the car and think that we are spies . '' Tariq was frightened about our trip , even though he is from Falluja and we had permission from one group of fighters to enter under their protection . But Tariq , more than anyone , understands that the fighters are no longer just one group . He is quite a character , Tariq : 32 and an engineer with a masters degree in embryo implantation , he works now at a human rights institute called the Democratic Studies Institute for Human Rights and Democracy in Baghdad . He is also deeply into animal rights . Foolishly , I took a pill to try to keep down the flu , which made me sleepy . It was 9am when we crossed the main southern gate out of Baghdad , taking care to stay well clear of American convoys . The southern gate is the scene of daily attacks on the Americans by the insurgents - either a car-bomb or an ambush with rocket-propelled grenades . It took just 20 minutes from Baghdad to reach the area known as the `` triangle of death '' , where the kidnapped British contractor Kenneth Bigley was held and finally beheaded in the town of Latifya . It is supposed to be a US military-controlled zone , but insurgents set up checkpoints here . As the road became more rural and more isolated , I got nervous that at any moment we would be stopped by carjackers and robbed of our expensive equipment . At a checkpoint a hooded face came to the window ; he was carrying an old AK47 on his shoulder and looking for a donation towards the jihad . There were six fighters in total , all hooded . The driver and Tariq both made a donation ; I was frightened he would search the car and find the camera , so I gave him my Iraqi doctor 's ID card , hoping that would work . He apologised and asked that we excuse him . Now , there was nothing ahead but the sky and the desert . It was 1.30 pm and a bad time to use this road ; we had been told that carjackers were particularly active at this time of day . Tariq pointed out four young men dressed in red , their two motorbikes parked by the side of the road . They were planting a small , improvised explosive device made out of a tin of cooking oil for the next American convoy to leave the base outside Falluja . It was 3.30 pm before we got to Habbanya , a tourist resort on a lake supplied with fresh water by the Euphrates , which was once controlled by Uday , Saddam 's oldest son . It was here that Fallujans , who used to be wealthy as they supplied a lot of the top military for Saddam 's army , came for holidays . Now the place was freezing , and full of refugees . All the holiday houses were crammed with people , sometimes two families to a room . The first family we came across had been there since a month before the attack started . A man called Abu Rabe'e came up . He was 59 and used to be a builder ; he said he had a message for our camera . `` We 're not looking for this sort of democracy , this attacking of the city and the people with planes and tanks and Humvees . '' He had also fled Falluja with his family . They were all living in a former mechanic 's garage in Habbanya . Most of the people we spoke to in Habbanya were poor and uneducated , and had fled Falluja in anticipation of the US attack . Some were in tents ; others were sharing the old honeymoon suites where newlyweds used to come when this was a holiday resort . They squabbled among themselves to persuade me to film the conditions they were living in . There was still a fairground in Habbanya , but nothing was working . In the middle of the bumper cars an old lady had pitched a tent with bricks , where she was living with her son . I tried to talk to her but she told me to go away . There was no cooking gas in Habbanya , so the Fallujan refugees were cutting down trees to keep warm and cook food . Then someone came up and said the resistance fighters had heard we were asking questions . We decided to put the camera away and go to a friendly village that our driver knew . It was also filled with refugees from Falluja . One 50-year-old man , a major in the Iraqi Republican Guards under the former regime , took us in . There were four families squeezed into one apartment , all of them once wealthy . The major , like the others , was sacked after the liberation when the US disbanded the army and police . Now jobless , his house in Falluja was wrecked and he was a refugee with his five children and wife near the town where he used to spend his holidays . He was angry with the Americans , but also with the Iraqi rebels , whom he blamed , alongside the clerics in the mosques , for causing Falluja to be wrecked . `` The mujahideen and the clerics are responsible for the destruction that happened to our city ; no one will forgive them for that , '' he said with bitterness . `` Why are you blaming them - why do n't you blame the Americans and Allawi ? '' said Omar , the owner of the apartment . `` We told the mujahideen to leave it to us ordinary Fallujans , but those bloody bastards , the sheikhs and the clerics , are busy painting some bloody mad picture of heaven and martyrs and the victory of the mujahideen , '' said Ali , another refugee . `` And , of course , the kids believe every word those clerics say . They 're young and naive , and they forget that this is a war against the might of the machine of the American army . So they let those kids die like this and our city gets blown up with the wind . '' I wanted to ask the tough old Republican guard why they had let these young muj have the run of the city , but I actually did n't have to . I remember being in Falluja just before the fighting started and seeing a crowd gathered around a sack that was leaking blood . A piece of white A4 paper was stuck on to the sack , which read : `` Here is the body of the traitor . He has confessed to acting as a spotter for American planes and was paid $ 100 a day . '' At the same time as we were standing looking at the sack , I knew I would be able to buy a CD of the man in this sack making his confession before he was beheaded in any CD shop in Falluja . These were the people who controlled Falluja now - not old majors from Saddam 's army . In the morning we went back towards Falluja and heard that there were queues of people waiting to try to get back into the city . The government had made an announcement saying that the people from some districts could start to go back home ; they promised compensation . About midday we got a mile east of the city and saw that four queues had formed near the American base . They were mostly men , waiting for US military ID to allow them back home .

AFP In an effort to defuse what will likely be the biggest point of contention in their Tuesday White House meeting , British Prime Minister David Cameron is expected to tell President Obama that the release of convicted Pan Am Flight 103 bomber Abdel Baset al-Megrahi was `` wrong . '' In their first White House meeting , the two leaders are also expected to discuss Afghanistan , BP 's handling of the oil spill in the Gulf and its alleged role in the release of al-Megrahi . In an interview with BBC news , Cameron , who was elected prime minister in May , said he `` deeply regrets '' the pain the decision caused , but asserted that the release of al-Megrahi in August of last year was the decision of the Scottish government alone . `` All I know is , as leader of the opposition , I could not have been more clear that I thought the decision to release al-Megrahi was completely and utterly wrong , '' be told the BBC . Cameron said on the topic , '' I have no idea what BP did . `` There was no discussion with the UK government about the release of al-Megrahi , '' said Carl-Henric Svanberg . Al-Megrahi , who suffered from prostate cancer , was released in August 2009 by Scottish officials on `` compassionate grounds '' after he was given only 3 three-months to live . Al-Megrahi received a hero 's welcome when he returned to his native Libya -- where he is still living -- almost one year later . Just as British-owned BP sealed the oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico , the company came under fire again , but this time for allegations that BP , which has lucrative oil contracts in Libya , lobbied the British government in 2007 to proceed with a UK-Libya prisoner transfer agreement . BP has acknowledged it warned the Labor government of a possible `` negative impact on UK commercial interests , '' but denies there were any discussions with either the UK or Scottish government about al-Megrahi . British Foreign Secretary William Hague said Saturday there was no evidence BP had any connection with al-Megrahi 's release , but there is little doubt Prime Minister Cameron , who travels to Capitol Hill for meetings with House and Senate leadership Tuesday , will be peppered with BP questions . Just last week New York Democratic Senator Chuck Schumer called on the company to suspend oil drilling plans in Libya until the company 's role in the release of al-Megrahi is investigated . `` The bottom line is simple : If it walks like a duck and quacks like a duck , then it just might be a corrupt deal between BP , the British government and Libya , '' said Schumer , who lost numerous constituents in the December 21 , 1988 , bombing , `` Back in 2007 , BP and the Libyan government struck a $ 900 million oil deal that the prime minister , Tony Blair , helped coordinate , '' said Schumer in a news conference with reporters . `` But the deal ran into roadblocks , and BP admits that it pushed the British government to expedite a prisoner exchange agreement with Libya to smooth the way for an oil deal . We then know that the British government agreed to release al - Megrahi based on a fraudulent doctor 's prognosis that he only had three months to live . All of a sudden , once Megrahi is released , all the roadblocks to that oil deal are removed and , lo and behold , the oil deal is finally approved . If anyone thinks this is a coincidence , I have them a bridge to sell them in Brooklyn , '' the senior senator from New York charged . In his interview with BBC , Cameron said on the topic , `` I have no idea what BP did . I am not responsible for BP . '' But BP and the oil spill the in the gulf have strained relations between the U.S. and U.K. since the Deepwater Horizon rig explosion on April 20th . And as British prime minister , Cameron has had to lead the defense of the British-owned company amid harsh criticism from the American government and its citizens affected by the spill . June was an especially tough month for relations . As tens of thousands of barrels of oil continued to spill into the Gulf , President Obama , who early on in the environmental disaster referred to the company as `` British Petroleum , '' said he would have fired BP CEO Tony Hayward . The president also embraced the idea that the oil company suspend its quarterly dividend and criticized BP for spending money on a PR campaign . The angry words from Washington produced a backlash in the U.K. , where millions of British retirees depend on BP , the world 's third-largest oil company , for their pensions . And Cameron had promised to press Obama during their one-on-one first meeting during the G8\\/G20 in Toronto , for a dollar amount so BP would have an idea of the final costs related to the oil spill . No such request was made , at least publicly . Relations between the two countries seem to have simmered since Hayward was pulled from handling the oil spill 's day-to-day operations and President Obama sat down with BP Chairman Carl-Henric Svanberg . The administration 's meeting with BP executives in June led to the company 's announcement of a $ 20 billion escrow fund over 4 years , to pay claims to Gulf Coast residents and business owners affected by the spill . Following the four hour meeting with senior administration officials , the chairman also announced the suspension of dividend payments to shareholders and the creation of a $ 100 million fund to assist out of work oil workers following the government 's six month moratorium on deepwater drilling . Tuesday 's Oval Office meeting will be the second time the two world leaders are meeting , and the first time in the U.S. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs said of all topics to be discussed , Afghanistan topped the U.S. 's list of priorities . There are now approximately 10,000 British troops in Afghanistan as part of the NATO led effort and the British have seen an increase in causalities as of late . The U.K. hopes to have withdrawn all its forces by 2015 . Asked if Obama would try to dissuade Cameron from naming a target date , Gibbs said , `` it is hard to look that far into the future . Obviously , the president has committed to July of 2011 as a date of our transition and begin to , based on -- judging that based on the conditions on the ground to begin removing some of the troops that -- that the president added as a part of our increased resources there over the past couple years . '' Following their Oval Office sit down , Obama and Cameron will participate in an East Room joint press conference . The events speak to the often described `` special relationship '' between the U.S. and U.K. , but its a welcome Prime Minister Cameron 's predecessor did not receive . President Obama welcomed British Prime Minister Gordon Brown to the White House just six weeks after being sworn in himself , but the meeting between the president and the prime minister of one of the U.S. 's biggest allies was lackluster . Many Brits considered it a snub that Brown was only received for an Oval Office sit down meeting -- no joint press conference in the East Room or Rose Garden as his predecessor Tony Blair frequently participated in during his tenure with former President George W. Bush . Of course , Blair 's relationship with Bush was questioned back at home with many charging Bush treated Blair as a `` lap dog . '' According to Heather Conley of Center for Strategic and International Studies , a think tank in Washington , in forging his relationship with this U.S. president , Cameron needs to strike a balance between the perceived `` subordinate , ` poodle ' relationship '' he had with Bush , and Gordon Brown 's `` dour , technocratic approach . '' `` It remains to be seen if the two leaders will develop that ` special ' chemistry that has been historically evident between American and British leaders but appears to be somewhat elusive between President Obama and other world leaders , '' said Conley .

He is also the host of a new weekly PBS show. more '' Amid the financial chaos and economic uncertainty that has rocked world markets , I can see one silver lining . This crisis has forced the United States to confront the bad habits it developed over the past few decades . If we can kick those habits , today 's pain will translate into gains in the Since the 1980s , Americans have consumed more than they produced and have made up the difference by borrowing . Two decades of easy money and innovative financial products meant that virtually anyone could borrow any amount for any purpose . Household debt ballooned from $ 680 billion in 1974 to $ 14 trillion today . The average household has 13 credit cards , and 40 percent of these carry a balance , up from 6 percent in 1970 . But the average American 's behavior was virtuous compared with government behavior . Every city , county and state has wanted to preserve its proliferating operations yet not raise taxes . How to square this circle ? By borrowing , using ever more elaborate financial instruments . Local pols were n't the only problem . Under Alan Greenspan , the Federal Reserve refused to inflict pain . The economic slowdown after Sept. 11 ? Whatever the problem , the solution was to keep money flowing and goose the economy . In 1990 , the national debt was $ 3 trillion . It is now $ 10.2 trillion . If there is a lesson to be taken from this crisis , it 's an old rule : There is no free lunch . Now , debt is not a bad thing . Used responsibly , it is at the heart of modern capitalism . But hiding mountains of debt in complex instruments is an invitation to irresponsible behavior . In the short term , governments must take on more debts and obligations to resolve the crisis . But that does n't mean we should stimulate the economy with more tax cuts , as some economists advocate . That would only keep the party going artificially . A far better stimulus would be to expedite major infrastructure and energy projects , which are investments , not consumption , and have a different effect on fiscal fortunes . In the longer term , we have to get back to basics . Government should put incentives in place that make saving more likely . The U.S. government offers enormous incentives to consume -LRB- the mortgage interest tax deduction being the best example -RRB- , and it works . We have the world 's biggest houses and the most cars . If we were to tax consumption and encourage savings , that would also work . Regulations on credit card debt should be revised to ensure that people understand their risks . Paul Volcker has long argued that the recent financial innovation simply shuffled around existing resources while contributing few real benefits to the economy . Such activity will now be reduced significantly .

What is more natural , or compatible with , or what works better with , capitalism ? Taxes , or borrowing ? Both are used , but borrowing -LRB- using complex financial instruments -RRB- is getting out of hand , and tax cuts need to be used cyclically which means to not use them all the time , but sometimes , in response to certain economic conditions . Certain types of borrowing -LRB- borrowing based on complex financial instruments is one example -RRB- are risky mortgage-backed securities have proven this . The return -LRB- % -RRB- was known , but mortgages that go unpaid are worth very little they result in mortgage-backed securities with 0 return . A lot of Americans wonder what could have been done differently to avoid this economic crisis ? Change the tax policy temporarily repeal tax cuts , starting about 3 years ago ? More government intervention starting about 3 years ago when home values were inflated ? Simply more government intervention ? More infrastructure and energy investments starting about 3 or 4 years ago ? Should lenders and credit card companies have been less generous ? Were they pushing credit onto borrowers with the hopes of it being repaid , with a disregard of the borrowers long-term ability to repay -LRB- and their unwillingness to repay in full in the short term ? Is Wall Street to blame ? Mr. Zakeria has a very accurate perception of the problem , but is there a solution ?

Send us an e-mail . Friday , September 19 , 2008 ; 1:00 PM Every hour seems to bring a new financial crisis to the fore on Wall Street . Certified Financial Planner Barbara A. Warner , president of Warner Financial , Inc. in Bethesda , Md. , was online Friday , September 19 at 1 p.m. ET to discuss guidelines for how to handle your personal finances amidst the turmoil . Durham , N.C. : Hi . I 'm a bit confused about the security of my mutual funds and stocks I have with my investment bank -LRB- which is not one of the ones going under -- at least yet -RRB- . What happens to those funds and stocks if the bank goes under -LRB- none of the funds contain investments in the bank , and none of the stocks are stock in the bank itself -RRB- ? Laziness is working for me for once . : Several months ago , a generous relative gave me a large some of money and I never got around to putting into my Roth IRA which is very diversified . I figure now is a good time to invest . Potomac , Md. : Barbara , I 've been putting off getting a financial planner for years now , but after the recent market roller coaster , I feel that it 's finally time . However , I 've done little research into what characteristics and qualifications I should be looking for in a planner . Could you give me some insight this ? Arlington , Va. : Barbara , I recently started a new job that matches the first 5 % of my deposits into my 401k . Does that 5 % count against the federal limits -LRB- $ 15K , I believe -RRB- or do the limits only apply to what is actually taken out of my paycheck ? Arlington , Va. : Barbara , I guess my question is : where is all of this bail-out money coming from ? Are we going to be hit with huge tax increases to fund them ? Austin , Texas : How much money should I have in cash ? Where should I keep it ? Bank or Money Market ? Alexandria , Va. : Barbara , I have my savings in a small bank in Michigan , where I am from . I 've always felt very secure keeping my funds there , but now I find myself wondering if it 's false security . In general , what are the safest institutions for keeping savings ? Are smaller banks a bad bet ? Mine has locations in three states , all in the Midwest . But it 's not a national entity like Bank of America or anything like that . Am I being smart or stupid ? Arlington , Va. : My husband and I are saving for a house . At the moment , we own one condo that is upside down and another one that is not upside down but is also our main residence . Ultimately we want to sell them both and put the proceeds -LRB- if there are any -RRB- into our down payment for a bigger place . Is the current financial craziness on Wall Street going to translate into crazy high mortgage rate percentages ? If so , I fear we may be destined to live in our tiny condo for life . Rockville , Va. : I currently hold my cash in an online savings account paying 3 % . So why does anyone own a short-term T-bill paying 1-1 .5 % ? Potomac , Md. : I became a stay-at-home mom a couple years ago and living on one income was n't really working but we were n't starving . I started selling on eBay and pretty much treated it as a garage sale - sold things around my house I no longer needed . Well the first year or two I did n't make a lot -LRB- maybe $ 250 -RRB- but I did n't do it consistently either . In the past few months I 've been selling every month and have made a considerable sum . When do I have to start reporting this income to the IRS ? Meaning , a friend told me if you make less than $ 800 a year you do n't have to report it to the IRS . Anything over $ 801 you have to report . Bowie , Md. : I just found I 'm getting a raise that would put my income over the limit to make full-size -LRB- $ 5000 -RRB- Roth contribution for this year , which I 've already done . If I increase my 401k withholdings , are those effectively deducted from modified AGI , to keep me below the threshhold ? Anonymous : I have a fair amount of money in mutual funds , but very little in individaul stocks , so I am not too worried about the latest downturns in the stock market , but the actual and possible demise of more banks makes me a bit nervous about bonds held with Citicorp and Wachovia . The bonds do n't mature for several years . I would n't want to sell when the market is down , and doubt the banks will go belly-up , but , then people with Washington Mutual bonds probably said the same . I feel more confident about bonds I have with Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae since they seem okay -- for now . Potomac , Md. : Hi , I would like to generate income from my investments and feel uncertain about where to put my money to obtain about a 5 % return , without little risk to principle and no lock-in rules that come with CDs . Short-term Treasury bonds seem to be doing the best right now . How will these investments be impacted by the ongoing turmoil ? Bethesda , Md. : Hi Barbara . I switched jobs this year and came away with a $ 23K pension pay-out that I need to roll over into something else . I am considering going with a fund from Northwest Mutual but I also currently have an account with T. Rowe Price . Is there an advantage to going with one firm over the other ? Do they do different things or is it more of a Coke vs. Pepsi choice ? I have a Roth IRA with T. Rowe Price presently . I also need to decide what to do with my old 401k . I can either leave it with my old company , roll it over to my 401k with my new company , or invest it in a stand-alone account with T. Rowe Price or Northwest Mutual . Bronx , N.Y. : Hi Barbara . This might be a basic Investing 101 question , but I still do n't get it : with all the bad news coming from Wall Street and predictions that we have a ways to go before the economy rebounds , why does n't it make sense to pull all of our money out of stocks and put it into money market funds or savings accounts ? Then when the economy rebounds , we invest it again ? Just seems like the logical thing to do ! Ashburn , Va. : Hello , what would you suggest for an investor in his or her late 30s to do who has $ 100,000 - $ 150,000 parked in CDs , assuming he\\/she has a stable job , for long term investment ? I have been waiting for more than an year -LRB- since August -RRB- for the right time . Rockville , Md. : We are in the midst of a major remodeling at our home and have been caught off guard by how high prices have risen on everything from food to gas to , well , just about everything . Are there any good resources for people who want to get some personal financial guidance but ca n't afford to spend even more money to get that advice ? Arlington , Va. : Barbara , this might sound strange , but I am really worried about how all of this financial turmoil is going to affect my father . He 's 84 years old , lived through the Depression , was a company man for one of the car companies for 36 years , and retired 20 years ago with lots of money in the bank and in stocks .

It is Syria 's second largest city and its commercial hub , classified by UNESCO as a world heritage site because of its priceless cultural and architectural treasures . Until relatively recently , it had been able to stand aside from the turmoil that was tearing the rest of the country apart . A week after battles raged in parts of the capital , Damascus , now it 's Aleppo 's turn , as the rebels ratchet up the pressure in the apparent belief that their moment has come . So where does that leave Syria 's neighbors , and where does it leave the rest of the world ? I was struck by a line in an impressively dispassionate report published by the defense policy think-tank the Royal United Services Institute : '' ... the question of some sort of Western intervention in Syria has shifted from a predilection to stay out of the conflict in any physical sense to an awareness that intervention is looking increasingly likely . We are not moving towards intervention but intervention is certainly moving towards us . '' The argument goes like this : increasingly foreign governments are worrying about what 's likely to happen when -LRB- not if -RRB- Bashar al-Assad is forced out . In the words of RUSI 's director , Professor Michael Clarke : '' ... the regional implications of this dynamic of violence are more a driver of international diplomacy than the human misery inside Syria itself . '' Syria 's neighbor Lebanon is a tinderbox where just one spark can ignite a conflagration ; and Iraq and Iran , with their Shia majorities , are lined up against Turkey and Saudi Arabia , with their Sunni majorities . Professor Clarke talks of an `` arc of proxy confrontation '' between Iran and Saudi Arabia , which could lead to all kinds of trouble . Perhaps the question should be not `` Will outside powers intervene in Syria ? '' , but `` Will they intervene more than they are already ? '' As the RUSI report points out : '' Already , it is believed that western intelligence and special force operations are actively underway ... Western countries have backed the growing supply of arms , via Arab sources , to rebel forces for some months now ... Saudi Arabia and Qatar , with US and Turkish facilitation , have been arming and funding the opposition ; and this covert support has been substantially responsible for the progress opposition forces have made in recent weeks . '' On the government side , the report says : `` Several Russian ships carrying a range of military equipment for the Assad regime are already at sea ... '' And the Iranians are unlikely to stand idly by if they see their strategic interests put at risk : in order to preserve their influence with Shia groups in Lebanon , for example : `` the Iranians would provide weapons , materiel and probably elements of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to support Assad , as they did successfully with the Shia militias in Iraq . '' No one is suggesting that the West is likely to mount an Iraq-style international ground invasion , nor even a Libya-style air campaign . But RUSI 's Jonathan Eyal has this stark warning : `` Western governments which have long worked for Assad 's departure should now begin to fear what may lie in store . For , instead of imploding as other Arab countries did when they were gripped by revolutions , Syria will explode , disgorging its troubles across the entire Middle East , with potentially catastrophic consequences which will need to be managed , since they look unlikely to be avoided . '' And he makes this additional point : `` President Assad was -LRB- note the past tense -RRB- the region 's last secular strongman , the last of the Arab leaders who repressed religious and ethnic differences in the name of a higher pan-Arab ideology . His method of government is now as defunct as that of the Soviet Union or communist Eastern Europe , on which it was based . '' Until recently , the conventional wisdom was that international intervention in Syria simply was n't on the cards . If the RUSI report is right , it may be time to rethink some of those assumptions : just watch the price of oil if tensions rise and Western governments start to panic at the thought of further price pressures as they struggle to save their faltering economies .

Govt is in full control of the nation 's capital and has declared this victory . In Aleppo , Govt forces have regained control of most of the city with pockets of rebel fighters still active in the S.W. Aleppo District of Salaheddine . Bashar al-Assad `` s Govt declared victory on Sunday in a hard-fought battle for Syria 's capital Damascus , & subsequently , pounded rebels who control parts of its largest city Aleppo ... Helicopter gunships hovered over the city shortly after dawn & f artillery boomed across neighborhoods . Syrian state television said soldiers were repelling `` terrorists '' in Salaheddine and had captured several of their leaders . '' Syrian Foreign Minister Walid al-Muallem stated during a visit to Tehran : `` Today I tell you , Syria is stronger In less than one week the Opposition Forces were defeated in Damascus ; they failed . They moved on to Aleppo and `` I assure you , their plots will fail in Aleppo too . '' -- will the culprits please stand up and be counted . `` In the midst of World War I two Allied diplomats -LRB- Frenchman Fran ois Georges-Picot and Briton Mark Sykes -RRB- secretly agreed on the post war division of the Ottoman Empire into respective zones of influence . The end of the war and defeat of the Central Powers , of which the Ottoman Empire was one , allowed the victorious Entente powers of Britain and France to realize its provisions .

The rebel attacks on the cities of Damascus and Aleppo were intended to convince the west media rebels were near victory ; in reality , attacks in Damascus were instantly crushed by the Syrian Govt , while US media predicted `` victory just around the corner '' for opposition forces . Republicans accuse Obama of `` outsourcing '' the Syrian conflict , refusing to be involved when the rebels deserve extra support . Obama is the principal cause of Syrian humanitarian catastrophe . While Qatar & Saudi Arabia arm rebels of Syria ... Washington mutters not a word of criticism against them . President Barack Obama and his Secretary of State , Hillary Clinton , say they want `` democracy '' in Syria . Is n't Qatar an autocracy ? Is n't Saudi Arabia among a pernicious caliphate dictatorship ? But , they are also American puppets .

An outbreak of a form of influenza , which was known as swine flu before the World Health Organization changed the name , has killed scores in Mexico and infected others in the United States , Canada , Europe and New Zealand . It 's already having an effect on markets and travel plans , in addition to the obvious impact on public health . The impact on markets could become more significant in time , but the impact on the media was practically immediate . Cable television programmers went into crisis mode and a look at newspaper front pages and website home pages around the world showed a range of responses , from the almost hysterical to the concerned and more measured . In the New York Daily News : SWINE FLU SPREADS ! -LRB- though it was played below a sports story on the New York Yankees losing to the Boston Red Sox -RRB- .

Says . The BBC website focused on the confirmation of flu cases in the UK , with extensive Q&A 's on the origins of the disease and how it spreads and contributions from readers who were dealing with disease -LRB- some of them medical professionals in Mexico -RRB- . Big , bad-news stories can mean surges in audiences for media outlets and they certainly raise the adrenalin level of editors and reporters . They offer the temptation to go to excess , but they also offer the opportunity for us be of priceless service to our customers , clients and readers . The question for me is how we in the media make sure we report accurately and informatively on the story and its impact on the markets and consumers lives without minimizing and without sensationalizing it . `` This is the type of story where our goal to stay factual and keep perspective is essential to uphold , '' says Reuters Editor-in-Chief David Schlesinger . `` Our role is neither to trivialize nor to hype or scaremonger , but to describe accurately what is happening and put its implications in context . '' Reuters has focused a great deal of resources rightly , given our customers and audience on the implications for the markets and the impact on the global economic downturn . On Monday afternoon , Reuters.com was leading with Will global recovery catch the flu ? atop a package of stories on possible market scenarios , the EU travel warning and factboxes on health precautions and industries being affected . One story noted , not surprisingly , that travel and tourism stocks were in turmoil . Reuters.com also featured a special coverage page with the latest news , accompanied by a sober presentation of `` Swine Flu Facts . '' There 's even an invitation to receive updates on Twitter . Call me a skeptic on Twitter , but 140 characters wo n't do much to add context to the story . Still , no one ever said Twitter was about context and at least you can follow developments , whether or not you 're near a computer . My Reuters colleagues especially the ones working bravely and tirelessly in Mexico are succeeding in upholding the goal of staying factual and keeping events in perspective . It 's our mission to provide the information and insight our audience and customers need to make intelligent decisions about their investments and their lives . As shown by the World Health Organization 's decision Monday to raise the pandemic alert to Level 4 , and later to Level 5 , there 's plenty of drama to report without adding to it . The flu story is still in its early stages and it remains to be seen if this becomes one of the biggest stories of our time . Whatever happens , it wo n't hurt us all to take a deep breath now . The CANADIAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION -LRB- CMA -RRB- made a rather stark and dismal prediction in August of 2008 . And , the strange thing is ; there were no images of PERSONS , constantly appearing on the Main Stream Media -LRB- MSM -RRB- news papers , websites , and of course in High Definition on digital TVs wearing surgical or chemical masks -LRB- respirators -RRB- . The World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- had nothing much to say about this drastic prediction which the CMA had made . The CENTERS FOR DISEASE CONTROL & PREVENTION -LRB- CDC -RRB- in the UNITED STATES , also did not appear too concerned , especially given their close proximity to the geographic landmass known as Canada . The basis for my assumption , leading me to believe that neither of these CORPORATE organizations had attached much or any concern , actually became somewhat obvious . By this I make reference ; there was an imminent predicted demise of thousands , or perhaps hundreds of thousands of human beings , but yet , it was business as usual . You could have hopped on a jet plane and fly to Mexico , drive across the North American borders to do some shopping , no problemo ... no alert measures went into effect , i.e. , like the WHO is doing now , e.g. `` Alert 5 ? or , as the UNITED STATES HOMELAND SECURITY might soon do , with their trendy color system , e.g. `` Amber Alert . '' Well , I ve rambled on long enough now , so I ll come to my point : In August 2008 , the CMA claimed that up to 21,000 Canadians will die this year -LRB- 2008 -RRB- , due to air pollution , and with 3,000 of those deaths due to short-term exposure to smog . I don t know of any pharmaceutical research CORPORATIONS that are currently trying to develop a VACCINE for air pollution or SMOG . So , perhaps a flu pandemic might actually be a good thing ... being locked down in our homes , and or detained in FEMA detention camps , will definitely be pay back to the industry , which ultimately must bear the responsibility for the deaths of 21,000 human beings . Last reported , Mexico was losing $ 53 million dollars per day , because of the flu . Great to read a balance . I am in Mexico right now , been here some time . I am shocked at the BS media hype coming out in my country back home ... causing a panic . The main misleading statement is saying there are 150 dead without backing this up with the facts . The facts are only eight people have been officially confirmed deaths from the virus and these cases my not be directly from the virus . They also forget to mention the thousands who die of the flu and complications each year . e.g. about 100 a day in the USA alone . I think it is shameful they way the media is hypering this up and misleading the public . And the terrible impact on the country of Mexico . Mexico is a great place to live and retire , rated number one by the organization International living two years running . This is an alarm that world has to wake up .

It is a war that Barack Obama did n't want , David Cameron did n't need , Angela Merkel could n't cope with and Silvio Berlusconi dreaded . PARIS | Fri Apr 1 , 2011 9:14 am EDT PARIS -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - It is a war that Barack Obama did n't want , David Cameron did n't need , Angela Merkel could n't cope with and Silvio Berlusconi dreaded . Only Nicolas Sarkozy saw the popular revolt that began in Libya on February 15 as an opportunity for political and diplomatic redemption . Whether the French president 's energetic leadership of an international coalition to protect the Libyan people from Muammar Gaddafi will be enough to revive his sagging domestic fortunes in next year 's election is highly uncertain . But by pushing for military strikes that he hopes might repair France 's reputation in the Arab world , Sarkozy helped shape what type of war it would be . The road to Western military intervention was paved with mutual suspicion , fears of another quagmire in a Muslim country and doubts about the largely unknown ragtag Libyan opposition with which the West has thrown in its lot . That will make it harder to hold together an uneasy coalition of Americans , Europeans and Arabs , the longer Gaddafi holds out . Almost two weeks into the air campaign , Western policymakers fret about the risk of a stray bomb hitting a hospital or an orphanage , or of the conflict sliding into a prolonged stalemate . There is no doubt the outcome in Tripoli will have a bearing on the fate of the popular movement for change across the Arab world . But because this war was born in Paris it will also have consequences for Europe . `` It 's high time that Europeans stopped exporting their own responsibilities to Washington , '' says Nick Witney , a senior policy fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations . `` If the West fails in Libya , it will be primarily a European failure . '' When the first Arab pro-democracy uprisings shook the thrones of aging autocrats in Tunisia and Egypt in January , France had got itself on the wrong side of history . Foreign Minister Michele Alliot-Marie had enjoyed a winter holiday in Tunisia , a former French colony , oblivious to the rising revolt . She and her family had taken free flights on the private jet of a businessman close to President Zine al-Abidine Ben Ali , and then publicly offered the government French assistance with riot control just a few days before Ben Ali was ousted by popular protests . Worse was to come . It turned out that French Prime Minister Francois Fillon had spent his Christmas vacation up the Nile as the guest of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , the next autocrat in the Arab democracy movement 's firing line , while Sarkozy and his wife Carla had soaked up the winter sunshine in Morocco , another former French territory ruled by a barely more liberal divine-right monarch . Television stations were re-running embarrassing footage of the president giving Gaddafi a red-carpet welcome in Paris in 2007 , when Libya 's `` brother leader '' planted his tent in the grounds of the Hotel de Marigny state guest house across the road from the Elysee presidential palace . On February 27 , a few days after Libyan rebels hoisted the pre-Gaddafi tricolor flag defiantly in Benghazi , Sarkozy fired his foreign minister . In a speech announcing the appointment of Alain Juppe as her successor , Sarkozy cited the need to adapt France 's foreign and security policy to the new situation created by the Arab uprisings . `` This is an historic change , '' he said . `` We must not be afraid of it . We must have one sole aim : to accompany , support and help the people who have chosen freedom . '' MAN IN THE WHITE SHIRT Yet the international air campaign against Gaddafi 's forces might never have happened without the self-appointed activism of French public intellectual Bernard-Henri Levy , a left-leaning philosopher and talk-show groupie , who lobbied Sarkozy to take up the cause of Libya 's pro-democracy rebels . Libya was the latest of a string of international causes that the libertarian icon with his unbuttoned white designer shirts and flowing mane of greying hair has championed over the last two decades after Bosnian Muslims , Algerian secularists , Afghan rebels and Georgia 's side in the conflict with Russia . Levy went to meet the Libyan rebels and telephoned Sarkozy from Benghazi in early March . `` I 'd like to bring you the Libyan Massouds , '' Levy says he told the president , comparing the anti-Gaddafi opposition with former Afghan warlord Ahmad Shah Massoud , who fought against the Islamist Taliban before being assassinated . `` As Gaddafi only clings on through violence , I think he 'll collapse , '' the philosopher told Reuters in an interview . On March 10 , Levy accompanied two envoys of the Libyan Transitional Council to Sarkozy 's office . To their surprise and to the consternation of France 's allies , the president recognized the council as the `` legitimate representative of the Libyan people '' and told them he favored not only establishing a no-fly zone to protect them but also carrying out `` limited targeted strikes '' against Gaddafi 's forces . In doing so without consultation on the eve of a European Union summit called to discuss Libya , Sarkozy upstaged Washington , which was still debating what to do , embarrassed London , which wanted broad support for a no-fly zone , and infuriated Berlin , France 's closest European partner . He also stunned his own foreign minister , who learned about the decision to recognize the opposition from a news agency dispatch , aides said , while in Brussels trying to coax the EU into backing a no-fly zone . `` Quite a lot of members of the European Council were irritated to discover that France had recognized the Libyan opposition council and the Elysee was talking of targeted strikes , '' a senior European diplomat said . Across the Channel , British Prime Minister David Cameron , aware of the deep unpopularity of the Iraq war , had turned his back on Tony Blair 's doctrine of liberal interventionism when he took office in 2010 . But after facing criticism over the slow evacuation of British nationals from Libya and a trade-promotion trip to the Gulf in the midst of the Arab uprisings , he overruled cabinet skeptics , military doubters and critics among his own Conservative lawmakers to join Sarkozy in campaigning for military action . However , Cameron sought to reassure parliament that he was not entering an Iraq-style open-ended military commitment . `` This is different to Iraq . This is not going into a country , knocking over its government and then owning and being responsible for everything that happens subsequently , '' he said . In Britain , as in France , the government won bipartisan support for intervention . In Germany , on the other hand , the Libyan uprising was an unwelcome distraction from domestic politics . It played directly into the campaign for regional elections in Baden-Wuerttemberg , a south-western state which Chancellor Angela Merkel 's Christian Democrats had governed since 1953 . Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle , leader of the Free Democrats , the liberal junior partners in Merkel 's coalition , tried to surf on pacifist public opinion by opposing military action . Polls showed two-thirds of voters opposed German involvement in Libya , a country where Nazi Germany 's Afrika Korps had suffered desert defeats in World War Two . Present-day Germany 's armed forces were already overstretched in Afghanistan , where some 5,000 soldiers are engaged in an unpopular long-term mission . Westerwelle made it impossible for Merkel to support a no-fly zone , even without participating . He publicly criticized the Franco-British proposal for a U.N. Security Council resolution authorizing the use of force to prevent Gaddafi using his air force against Libyan civilians . Merkel said she was skeptical . The Germans prevented a March 11 EU summit from making any call for a no-fly zone , much to the frustration of the French and British . Relations between France 's Juppe and Westerwelle deteriorated further the following week when Germany prevented foreign ministers from the Group of Eight industrialized powers from calling for a no-fly zone in Libya .

VENICE , La\\/HOUSTON | Sun May 23 , 2010 7:25 pm EDT VENICE , La\\/HOUSTON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - The U.S. government threatened on Sunday to remove BP from efforts to seal a blown-out oil well in the Gulf of Mexico if it does n't do enough to stop the leak , though it acknowledged only the company and the oil industry have the know-how to halt the deepwater spill . The Coast Guard said on Sunday that over 65 miles of Gulf Coast has experienced `` shoreline impact '' and less than half of it could be cleaned up relatively quickly , underscoring the growing ecological toll of the disaster . Interior Secretary Ken Salazar said Washington is frustrated and angry that BP Plc missed `` deadline after deadline '' in its efforts to seal the well more than a month after an oil rig explosion triggered the disaster . `` I am angry and I am frustrated that BP has been unable to stop this oil from leaking and to stop the pollution from spreading . We are 33 days into this effort and deadline after deadline has been missed , '' Salazar said after visiting BP 's U.S. headquarters in Houston on Sunday . `` If we find they 're not doing what they 're supposed to be doing , we 'll push them out of the way appropriately , '' he told reporters as the administration maintained its hard line . Salazar 's strong comments followed President Barack Obama 's on Saturday , when he blamed the spill on `` a breakdown of responsibility '' at BP . The unfolding disaster has become a top priority on Obama 's crowded domestic agenda . The chief of the Coast Guard , Admiral Thad Allen , acknowledged on Sunday that the government is forced to rely on BP and the private oil sector to try to plug the gusher . At the same time , BP said the containment method it was attempting on the ocean floor was capturing much less of the leaking oil than three days ago . Company engineers were readying other short-term solutions , the next one expected to start late on Tuesday . But BP Managing Director Bob Dudley said there was `` no certainty '' of success at the unprecedented depths at which they were being tried -- one mile down in the Gulf of Mexico . More than a month after a rig explosion triggered what Obama has described as an environmental disaster and `` BP 's mess , '' oil is still spewing virtually unchecked from BP 's ruptured Macondo seabed well . At a time of mounting U.S. government and public criticism of the company and its executives over the catastrophic spill , Allen said he trusted BP Chief Executive Tony Hayward , who has made comments downplaying its size and environmental impact . Sheets of heavy oil have washed ashore in Louisiana 's fragile marshlands and lesser `` oil debris '' has also reached the coasts of Mississippi and Alabama in what is seen as an ecological and economic calamity for the U.S. Gulf Coast . Given the lack of a solution so far and the doubts over BP , Allen was asked on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' why the U.S. government did not completely take over the spill containment operation from the London-based firm . `` What makes this an unprecedented anomalous event is access to the discharge site is controlled by the technology that was used for the drilling , which is owned by the private sector , '' Allen said . `` They have the eyes and ears that are down there . They are necessarily the modality by which this is going to get solved , '' he added . Asked too about the apparent growing U.S. lack of confidence in Hayward , Allen said : `` I trust Tony Hayward . When I talk to him , I get an answer . '' BP has deployed a long suction tube down to the larger of two leaks from the well , but a BP spokesman said on Sunday this captured only 1,360 barrels per day of oil over the 24 hours to midnight Saturday . The flow has been declining from the 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- per day the company had said the tube was siphoning off three days ago . BP engineers are now preparing a `` top kill , '' pumping heavy fluids into the well to try to shut it off , an operation to begin late Tuesday or early Wednesday , Dudley told CNN . Many scientists believe the Gulf spill has already eclipsed the 11 million gallons -LRB- 41 million liters -RRB- spilled by the 1989 Exxon Valdez tanker accident in Alaska . They warn the spreading oil could be caught in a powerful ocean current that could take it to the Florida Keys , Cuba and the U.S. East Coast . Coast Guard Admiral Mary Landry said 65.6 miles of shoreline has been impacted so far and about 30 acres of marshland . She told a briefing that of the area affected on the coast `` 25 miles ... are really readily cleanable and the others are a little harder access but we 'll get to it . '' Of the impacted marshland about half of it has heavily oiled she said the rest `` lightly oiled with sheen . '' Churchgoers in Louisiana coastal parishes affected by the spill prayed for God 's help . `` You -LRB- God -RRB- can clear that oil up , because that oil was down there thousands of years before it came up in the Gulf . So you know what to do with it , dear God , '' retired oyster fisherman Herbert Guidry prayed in the New Mount Pilgrim Baptist Church in Houma . Analysts say growing ecological and economic damage from the spill could become a political liability for Obama before November congressional elections . While also promising to hold Washington accountable for proper oversight of the industry , Obama ramped up pressure on companies linked to the spill : BP , Halliburton and Transocean Ltd. . He believed a `` breakdown of responsibility '' between them led to the disaster . BP stocks have taken a beating in the markets in the month since the well blowout and rig explosion that killed 11 workers and touched off the spill . Its share price shed another 4 percent on Friday in London , extending recent sharp losses . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Fail closed simply means that they are designed so that they need to be activated to remain open , or in the absence of a signal to an activator forcing them open they close . This is mandated in many situations for safety and fire prevention . It must be mandated on Blow Out Preventers for all offshore rigs . The industry will lobby to avoid this so we the people must be diligent in demanding it without loop holes . Please copy this and post it every where you can Do the math , it s ALWAYS ABOUT THE MONEY at 70,000 barrels a day x $ 70 a barrel BP will make $ 766,500,000 a year . If BP stops the leak they would not be allowed to complete the two relief wells . Once their grouse negligence is brought out , they would never be allowed to drill that reservoir . So they keep it leaking because that reservoir will pay for the clean up . They are not about to loose $ 10,000,000,000 dollars over the life of the reservoir and pay the clean up cost , unless the Government makes them . BP keeps taking wks between actions but they started drilling two wells right away . Bp should have a second pipe lowered and ready on stand by , they should have tried the hole shot wks ago and the mud fill wks ago . If BP would have stopped the leak wks ago they never get the $ 10,000,000,000 . If BP would come out $ 10,000,000,000 ahead by stopping the leak in 10 days they would have don it , but the clean up cost would have been about the same with no money from the relief wells .

He is now the scourge of neocons and the disciples of science and rationalism If you had to fit the message of John Gray 's 14 books and innumerable articles on a sandwich board , it would be simple : you 're all doomed . Quite who is doomed , and why , has varied with the development of his thought . He started off as a Thatcherite and cold warrior , convinced that the postwar consensus and welfare state could not last . As a writer and public intellectual , he has always argued against the conventional wisdom . `` He has no moral authority ; he is now the scourge of neocons and the disciples of science and rationalism , '' Thatcher once said . Now he attacks Blair as a dangerous neocon ; he has been an unyielding opponent of the Iraq war and he is convinced that globalisation will end in a welter of resource wars and ecological collapse . Peter Wilby , a former editor of the New Statesman who published him for three years , says : `` He 's one of life 's sceptics , really . Any kind of ideology - the more he looks at it , the more he decides that it crumbles apart . None of the emperors has any clothes so far as John is concerned . '' In all this , he sees himself as consistent . As a polemicist he has always argued against the conventional wisdom , and usually been about five years ahead of it . As a political philosopher , he believes he has always had a guiding principle : that there are certain limits on human life which politics can never abolish , and never wholly work around . Utopian or universal schemes will only make things worse . This sounds like conservatism ; but he also believes that real , reactionary conservatism is no longer possible : `` The right today likes to imagine that it is the voice of the past . In truth ... the fate of the right in the late modern age is to destroy what remains of the past in a vain attempt to recover it . '' Gray was born in 1947 into a world which the market has quite swept away : the working class of Tyneside , when they still had jobs . His father was a shipyard joiner in South Shields . They never thought of themselves as poor , he says ; others remember it differently . His childhood friend Robert Colls , now a historian at the University of Leicester , who grew up in the same part of town , remembers `` this poor brilliant boy living in a mixed area of town . His dad was disabled in his 50s . I think he had a hard time on the money front . '' In 1968 , he went up to Oxford to read PPE on a scholarship . Isaiah Berlin was at Oxford then , working on the most subtle and powerful justification for liberalism that anyone managed in the 20th century ; Gray , who became a friend , set out to overthrow it . Liberalism , said Berlin , is valuable because it lets people live in many different ways , seeking many different goals . But no one society , Gray objects , can encompass all the humanly fulfilling ways to live . Russia under totalitarianism\\/communism was in some respects less materialistic and more respectful of culture than it is now , but these virtues were made possible only by a dreadful tyranny . His arguments on this topic are pitched in academic prose , but they can be boiled down into one line of Mick Jagger 's : We ca n't get no satisfaction . We are not the sort of creatures who could get lasting satisfaction , not just because we often want bad things instead of good ones , but because the goods we want ca n't be reconciled with each other . The Australian philosopher George Crowder claims that Gray must logically endorse Stalin and Hitler as offering legitimate models of society , something Gray cheerfully denies . The fact that our values , though real , are sometimes incompatible does n't mean they have nothing in common . It must be possible , he claims , to build some kind of minimal universal moral framework , even if this does not lead to liberalism : `` No society can be called good which rests on torture . '' His pessimistic twist on Berlin is also part of the rootless conservatism which has made him denounce the projects of the right as passionately as he denounced Marxism . He believes that human life can always be made better , but that this process does not approach perfection . New problems are always arising ; old gains can easily be lost . There is no steady ladder of progress ; but we are able , sometimes , to run up the down escalator . He rejects the idea that political debate starts from human rights . The process seems to him the other way round : that `` rights '' are something that emerge from a political process , and different rights may be produced under different political systems . None is inherent in all human beings , and the ones that we do recognize may conflict with each other . When they do so , we ca n't honestly resolve the problem by logic which everyone comes to accept , nor even , as Americans do , by handing the matter over to a Supreme Court . The final decision , says Gray , must be political . As a working-class undergraduate , he was a Thatcherite before Thatcher herself , a believer in the market , and a critic of planned economies . He read Hayek in the late 1960s , and understood his essential point to be that markets in some sense know more than any of the people who operate in them . It followed that state planning , and social engineering based on rational discussion were always likely to go wrong . This much was common among Thatcherites in the 70s , but unlike most Thatcherites , he saw that ripping down communities to make way for a market was itself a form of social engineering , though an often anti-social one . `` Give him any collection of pigeons and he 'll set a cat among them , '' says his friend the academic and publisher Henry Hardy . Gray 's views on council-house sales are a good example of his contrarian style - and of his appetite for anchoring large arguments in historical detail . The sale of council houses , he said , might have been good for the Conservative party in the short term , but it did nothing to decrease dependency on the state , as it was supposed to do . All it changed was the form of subsidy . `` Spending on housing benefit during 1996-67 was over 10 times the total cost of housing benefits in 1979-80 . Public expenditure on social housing was replaced , many times over , by rent rebates and assistance with the payment of mortgages . The price of privatising municipal housing in Britain has been a colossal increase in welfare dependency . '' This kind of inconsistency in Thatcherism led to his conversion to Blairism . As a Blairite in the days before there was a Blair government , he started to attack the costs of the free market : `` In the United States free markets have contributed to social breakdown on a scale unknown in any other developed country . Families are weaker in America than in any other country . At the same time , social order has been propped up by a policy of mass incarceration . No other advanced industrial country , aside from post-communist Russia , uses imprisonment as a means of social control on the scale of the United States . Free markets , the desolation of families and communities and the use of the sanctions of criminal law as a last recourse against social collapse go in tandem . '' Thatcherism was not just a local phenomenon . It was also recognized as a global symbol , and this was the next symbol against which he charged . Nothing could be more alien to his temperament than the 90s ' bland optimism that history was over and the whole world must converge , with greater or lesser success , on the model of the United States of America . For one thing , he argued , globalisation depends on the world being different .", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "John Gray's thoughts on politics and society are shaped by his pessimistic view of human nature.

Follow live updates here BP revealed yesterday that plans to stop oil leaking into the Gulf of Mexico following the Deepwater Horizon explosion had suffered a setback when a build up of crystallized gas blocked pipes in one of its giant sunken towers . The oil company 's long term plan is to drill a relief well from a second oil rig in the Gulf , allowing it to continue to extract the oil . The company 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , is giving an update at a press conference in Houston , Texas . Follow live updates from BP here , and email adam.gabbatt@guardian.co.uk or tweet @adamgabbatt with your thoughts . We 're due to begin any minute . I 'm just being bombarded with classical music at the moment . Hayward says they fight the leak on three fronts - beneath the surface , on the surface , and on the shore . In the `` subsea '' it is the first time the industry has had to deal with anything at this depth . A lot of `` real time learning going on '' . Hayward says the dome was n't as successful as they 'd hoped . There is a lot more gas emerging than they had thought . In the meantime they are moving to position a smaller dome . They refer to the smaller dome as a `` top hat '' . It 's about the size of a barrel - a lot , lot smaller than the 12m high cofferdam they had started using . It will be a lot less effective in capturing the oil , but could be operating within 72 hours . The other measure on the sea bed is to tap into the riser further along the sea bed , and `` tap into '' the riser directly , without having to mess around with sea water contamination . The riser is essentially the pipe that would have pumped the oil to the surface before the explosion . BP have `` an armada of ships '' skimming oil . They 've skimmed over 100,000 barrels of oily water , as well as spraying dispersant . They now have a million feet of boom deployed , with a further 2.5 m in transit . They have thousands of volunteers signed up , and thousands of vessels have applied to participate in the clean up , although at the moment the oil is `` not getting anywhere near the shore , '' Hayward says . `` Could you say why an effort like this was n't anticipated to a greater extent and why you 're having to make it up as you go ? '' The investigation of this incident will through up things we should have been doing differently , Hayward says . Particularly on the failure of the blow out preventer and the inadecuacy of the industry to act at such depths . The industry has not hitherto had an issue of this sort to contend with , he says . Until you come to a specific problem it is difficult to know what you may need to solve it . A lot of learning is going on . What are the risks of the junk shot ? Could it make matters worse ? The risks of that are very very very very low , Hayward says . BP will be trying to make sure this intervention has upsides and no downsides . There have been fears that the junk shot could damage partially working valves which are preventing the leak from being as bad as it could be . Why did n't the dome work ? In the design criteria of the larger dome , we ca n't pump enough water down over it to stop it freezing , Hayward says . The smaller dome should not be as susceptible to the freezing which prevented the first from working . There 'll probably be some generic lessons to be learned , Hayward says . But he wo n't speculate . What will the leak mean for BP and the industry ? It 's a serious situation for BP , Hayward says . We will resolve it , its just a question of how long it will take . I suspect there will be specific findings regarding the ability to intervene 5,000 ft underwater , he reckons . There should be lessons for the industry . Is the junk shot going directly into the well bore ? It will go down `` choke and kill lines '' , into the blowout preventer . Then it will seal the blow out preventer . They would be pumping material into the internals of the blowout preventer , Hayward says . I think the junk shot will go into the blowout preventer . Why was BP so unprepared ? Were there flaws in the level of preparedness ? Hayward says the company is implementing its spill response plan rigirously . It has been very effective in stopping oil getting to the shore . It is the largest spill response effort mounted in the history of the industry . He says the issue of preparedness is around the blowout preventer . The industry will learn from this and make more changes . Tell us about the drilling of the relief well , and what you have in place if that does n't work ? What are the risks it does n't work ? We 're drilling two relief wells , says H , to give ourselves `` belt and braces '' . This should guarantee success . The relief wells will be successful says a confident Hayward . How do you know you 've been successful if you do n't know how quickly the oil is coming out , asks a hack ? By the fact we have contained the oil within the immediate vicinity of the well , says H. Hayward 's off . Kent Wells , senior vice president in BP 's exploration and production business is taking over . Wells is elaborating on the technical aspects . Specifically `` sub sea '' . This is an unprecedented challenge , he says . BP has assembled a small army . They have people from just about every oil and gas company , from the government , from everywhere . BP wants multiple options at combatting the spill . They 're `` designing every option to be successful , and planning for it to fail '' . He 's going to talk about the top hat , then the junk shot . BP felt the big cofferdam -LRB- the 90 tonnes one -RRB- was the best option . But they were aware it may not work . It had a 12 inch opening , and they were going to pump warm water down the pipe to keep it warm and prevent the slush effect that actually ioccurrec , stopping them from pumping off water . Now they 've gone from `` one extreme to the other '' . The `` top hat '' dome is 5ft tall , 4ft wide . Warm sea water will be pumped down . As they lower the dome it will already be operational - hooked up to a ship on the surface . It will be more difficult to place but they will succeed . It should be in place by the end of the week . BP is also trying to shut off the flow . Control pads connected the blowout preventer do n't work because they were attached to the rig , which sank . The junk shot will bung up the blowout preventer . They want a mix of different size of materials that will go in and hold - such as golf balls . BP has been experimenting with different `` recipes '' of junk If one recipe does n't work they 'll try something else . They will follow it with cement , and permanently abandon the well . It will take up to two weeks to work . Shutting of the well -LRB- in this fashion or any other -RRB- is BP 's number one priority . More on the junk shot . Choke and kill lines give an access through valves into the well . The junk shot would go down those lines and clog up blow out preventers . It has been used elsewhere successfully , but not at 5,000 ft - nothing has , Wells says . Could the junk shot make matters worse ?

World Routes -- An Appalachian Road Trip Fifty years after Alan Lomax and Shirley Collins traveled through the American south , documenting its unique personalities and music , writer and musician Banning Eyre embarks on his own Appalachian road trip to discover the American folk music that was born there in the 18th and 19th centuries . He visits the small town of Mount Airy in Surry County , North Carolina , where he meets the extraordinary players and singers keeping this music alive , and finds out how `` old time '' music is the direct precursor of what is now called country and bluegrass . In an interview with musician and field recordist Mike Seeger , recorded just a few months before he died , Banning discovers the roots of the music in the parallel histories of the European settlers and African slaves . He finds out how , post-emancipation , a distinctly American music was forged from the interplay of the African banjo and the European fiddle . Banning then embarks on a cross-state journey to hear the music and the stories of some of the older players and singers who can trace a direct line back to before the age of the radio and gramophone , to when this music was a strictly oral tradition . Banning meets 90-year-old fiddler Jo Thomson -- perhaps the only known surviving old time , African-American stringband player . His playing and stories capture a period of time before the music was delineated on race grounds . Banning also meets eighth-generation ballad singer Sheila Kay Adams . She tells stories and sings songs as her grandmother taught her . And 89-year-old Benton Flippen and his Smokey Valley boys provide remnants of a past age and of the heyday of old-time stringband .

Carlo is devastated and searches for a new role as liberator of Flanders . The title role is taken by one of today 's most admired tenors , Jonas Kaufmann , with soprano Marina Poplavskaya as Elizabeth of Valois and Ferruccio Furlanetto as Philip II of Spain . Around this tragic central triangle is a wider confrontation between authoritarian religion , represented by John Tomlinson 's Grand Inquisitor , and political liberation , represented by Carlo 's closest friend , the Marquis of Posa , sung by Simon Keenlyside .

A pipeline that sends natural gas to Jordan was set on fire in the Egyptian Sinai town of El Arish on Saturday , and the suspected act of sabotage has forced its temporary closing , officials said . Ghaleb Al Maabreh , head of Jordan 's national electricity company , confirmed the closing . He said at least one week will be needed to fix it and the cost for the repair will be covered by Jordan . Al Maabreh said the government will start using alternative sources that will cost it $ 4.2 million daily . It is able to provide itself with energy sources for the coming three weeks , he added . Unless the pipe is repaired quickly , it could become a big problem for Jordan , a country already spending heavily in fuel subsidies , a Jordanian senior official said . Read more ... February 6th , 2011 11:14 am ET Current events in the middle east have become very clear . Here are a few details which will help you understand . OPEC is an oil cartel\\/monopoly which is run by 11 heads of state from the middle east . American statesmen have declared that the price of oil is inflated because of this monopoly . They think OPEC 's monopoly threatens Americas need for cheap oil . They think if OPEC should be broken up -LRB- Lets say OPEC group A & OPEC group -RRB- then competition between rival OPEC A & B would drive down the price of oil . Next you must be aware that the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt has been set up and funded by Britain 's MI5 since the 1920s . The Muslim Brotherhood were used by the British to revolt against President Nasser during the Suez crisis . The Muslim Brotherhood are calling for revolution throughout the middle east . This equates to Britain and her allies wanting revolution throughout the middle east . Couple this with Americans calling for the breakup of OPEC and it becomes clear that the plan by the west is to dismantle this area . For example , if Saudi Arabia exploded into revolution it may split into North Saudi and South Saudi . With all the middle east in revolution the 11 OPEC members could be split into 22 OPEC members . But the 22 will be rivals , form separate groups and create competition in oil sales which will drive down the price . However the game cant end with a breakdown of OPEC . The resulting cheap oil will also be available to China . For America to control the cheap oil , it will need to keep the area in a state of constant chaos and on the edge of war . This will create the excuse for America to deploy its military and pretend that its in the region to create peace . The exchange for this calculated peace will be for the cheap oil to be directed to America . Some will argue that most of the dictators in the middle east are puppets installed by America and that the USA is already in control . This is correct , but only to a certain level . Most of the American backed middle east dictators have become +30 year family dynasties . They will follow America to a point . But if the USA wants utter turmoil which can threaten the succession of the family dynasty , the dictators will defy the will of America . i.e. for Mubarak it was more important that his son takes power , obeying the USA had become a secondary priority . America threw the stone of revolution in the middle east and tried hide its hand . Thats why they started with claims of support for Mubarak . It was not supposed to look like an American driven revolt . But when Mubarak found a way to cling onto power , the Americans realized their plan may fail . Hence the Americans started to announce Mubarak must go . There is no confusion in America , only a fear that their plan may not work . America hopes ElBaradei will take control of Egypt as he is their man and will follow the instructions needed to help break up OPEC and spread revolt . Israelis will now find that for 60 years they have been sleeping with the American mafia . It was fine for them as America -LRB- once the only super power -RRB- would back Israel in any crime or illegal occupation . Israelis were laughing at the Arabs as the grabbed more and more land with American support . But now America has a plan for middle east rebellion and instability to breakup OPEC . The instability needs to last generations , so the USA can have its military there to ensure the USA gets all the oil it wants . With this agenda , Mubarak and peace between Israel and Egypt is expendable . With turmoil in the middle east both Muslim and Jew will die and suffer . Israel is about to learn that when you sleep with the mafia you are expendable . Now some Israelis have a dream of a greater Israel which includes parts of Egypt , Jordan , Syria and Saudi Arabia . Some Israeli leaders may see the turmoil as a chance for more military victories and a chance to grab more land . They will sell the idea of conflict on the Israelis as they believe it will be for the countries greater good . Nevertheless , the price will be paid in Jewish and Muslim blood . Mubarak has played some extremely difficult cards with brilliance . He knows he has been betrayed by America and is probably buying time to establish better relations with Russia , China and Turkey . All the other Arab dictators have also seen how America may betray them . So do n't be surprised if China or Russia are invited to open naval or air bases in the middle east soon . America has taken an enormous gamble which will be paid for by everyone in the middle east . My guess is ; in the long term it will also accelerate the decline of American influence in the area . Conclusion , Israel better get to the negotiating table quickly and offer something that can be considered reasonable and serious . Get as much regional agreement as possible while you still hold the upper hand . The dynamics of the middle east are changing and you ca n't rely on the benefits of American mafia styled politics . America can wait for Mubarak to leave in September . The next opportunity for the USA to generate chaos now looks like it will be after he steps down . The next vote will be crooked as always and the dissatisfaction of the people will again be whipped up into anarchy . February 6th , 2011 4:45 pm ET p.s. Egyptian people have genuine concerns . Most of these concerns are based on the cost of living and limited chances to feed their families . The IMF -LRB- largely run by USA & UK -RRB- instructed Egypt to cut food subsidies or face a reduced credit rating . Its called banking poor countries into submission . They new Egyptian people would not be able to afford to eat and then they would blame the government . The IMF was the political tool used to spark this crisis . The the people of Jordan were then inspired by Egyptian protest and also start to protest themselves over their poor living conditions . And surprise surprise they have their gas cut off . An act intended to increase dissatisfaction in Jordan . How many more dirty tricks will we see in the Anglo American attempt to destabilize the middle east , cause revolt and breakup OPEC . People of the world from America to Jordan , from Egypt to Israel better start realizing they are all expendable pawns in the game played by our out of control governments -LRB- Goverments who serve the military industrial complex and banks , they dont serve you -RRB- . On a closing note Liberty and human rights are not subjects for governments to meddle with . On the other hand Democracy is two wolves and a sheep voting on whats for lunch . Instead of crowing about democracy in the world , we should be focusing on Liberty . The founding fathers of America said , `` Give me Liberty or Give me death '' .

The underlying fear is that Macondo is the oil industry 's Three Mile Island , an accident that turned public opinion against nuclear power for three decades . Investors are right to fear the long-term impact on the company . The catastrophic blowout at Macondo has sliced 40 percent off BP 's market capitalization . `` All options are on the table in response to the spill , '' Barack Obama said in a statement . BP however faces a very changed operating environment in future . Deepwater and ultra-deepwater petroleum wells are just one of a suite of advanced technologies energy producers have been using to extend the peak in conventional oil production . In its 2008 World Energy Outlook , the International Energy Agency -LRB- IEA -RRB- estimated worldwide deepwater and ultra-deepwater reserves at 200 billion barrels . Even complete loss of deepwater and ultra-deepwater oil production would have only a marginal impact on total energy supply in the decades to come . In any event , it seems unlikely deepwater exploration and production will be abandoned . Most policymakers recognize there is no practical alternative . Lukewarm public support for climate change legislation shows how little appetite there is for measures significantly increasing the cost of fossil fuels or forcing reductions in energy consumption . The industry actually has a good track record of operating in extremely challenging environments at huge depths and under massive pressures with few accidents . One reason Macondo has stirred such intense passions is because it is so unusual . The public , regulators and the industry itself have become used to the miracle of pulling oil up from deep below the surface without any real understanding of the engineering challenges involved . It has bred complacency . Deepwater drilling will continue , probably under a tougher permitting and inspection regime , with additional fail-safe and disaster-recovery systems , adding to the industry 's costs . But higher safety and compliance costs will not materially affect oil prices going forward . Extra compliance might add $ 2-3 to the price of a barrel of deepwater oil , but this is inconsequential compared with the vast expense of conducting seismic surveys under miles of seawater , mud and salt ; rig hire ; and the exploration risks of drilling dry wells . Anyway , oil prices are set at the margin by the highest-cost form of production , and deepwater and ultra-deepwater are not the marginal source of supply . Other technologies such as tar sands , shale oil , and in the medium-term gas-to-liquids -LRB- GTL -RRB- and coal-to-liquids -LRB- CTL -RRB- are all more expensive and will set prices , not deepwater . If it does happen , slower development of deepwater resources would have its biggest impact in the three-six year timeframe , when other technologies are still relatively immature and unable to fill the gap . For the moment , however , oil resources look comfortable in the medium term . The banking crisis and worldwide recession in 2007-09 have shifted the global economy onto a lower and slower growth trajectory , freeing up energy resources and improving the medium-term supply-demand outlook . Macondo would have had an enormous impact if it had occurred in H1 2008 . In the current environment , with spare capacity , the industry can absorb the potential loss of supply more easily . BILL STILL ON ROAD TO NOWHERE In the near term , Macondo complicates the passage of climate change legislation pending before the U.S. Senate . But the impact should not be exaggerated . The bill 's prospects were already poor and it has been heavily watered down . The emerging deal would have seen the Obama administration and congressional Democrats open up more offshore areas to drilling in exchange for at least some Republican and energy industry support for the modified cap-and-trade provisions set out in Senator John Kerry 's re-named American Power Act . That deal looks an increasingly hard sell , one reason President Barack Obama and senior officials are furious with BP . Even before the spill , however , it was far from clear the drilling-for-climate deal would secure the necessary 60 votes in the Senate to move forward . -LRB- 1 -RRB- Despite revisions to cap-and-trade , delaying its introduction for manufacturers and promising greater offshore acreage , there has been no lessening of hostility from Senate Republicans . The only Republican to support the compromise initially , South Carolina 's Senator Lindsey Graham , had already dropped his sponsorship under pressure from the party leadership and conservative activists . -LRB- 2 -RRB- Coastal Democrats were more or less united in their hostility to more offshore drilling well before Macondo . Ten coastal-state Democratic senators wrote to Kerry in March to oppose putting drilling into the climate and energy bill . They included Bill Nelson -LRB- Florida -RRB- , Robert Menendez and Frank Lautenberg -LRB- New Jersey -RRB- , Sheldon Whitehouse and Jack Reed -LRB- Rhode Island -RRB- , Barbara Mikulski and Ben Cardin -LRB- Maryland -RRB- , Ted Kaufman -LRB- Delaware -RRB- , and Ron Wyden and Jeff Merkley -LRB- Oregon -RRB- . `` While technological advances have attempted to lower the environmental and economic risks of drilling , experience has shown that no technology is foolproof ... Far from being a thing of the past , spills occur with alarming frequency '' , they wrote , with what now seems like horrible prescience . With industrial and coal-state Democrats opposed to raising the burden on manufacturers and coal-producers , coastal Democrats opposed to drilling , and Republicans leery of a potentially unpopular compromise , the climate bill has a mountain to climb , and is running out of time before the mid-term elections . UNLUCKY BP SET FOR BIG CHANGE While Macondo will not have much impact on the wider industry , the effect on BP itself could be far more severe . Since the problems with Exxon Valdez -LRB- 1989 -RRB- and Brent Spar -LRB- 1995 -RRB- , BP 's rivals Exxon and Shell have largely avoided major accidents . Both were searing experiences , prompting an overhaul of internal controls and safety culture . In contrast , BP 's North American operations have been plagued by a string of accidents and scandals -- including the Texas City refinery explosion -LRB- which killed 15 and injured 170 others in 2005 -RRB- ; the sinking of the celebrated Thunder Horse platform -LRB- 2005 -RRB- ; and leaks and corrosion on its Alaskan pipeline network . -LRB- 2006 -RRB- BP pleaded guilty to felony charges in the Texas City case , and was sentenced to $ 50 million fine and three-years probation . As BP American Chairman Bob Malone accepted at the time `` If our approach to process safety and risk management had been more disciplined and comprehensive , this tragedy could have been prevented '' . BP also received a fine and probation for Alaska . The company has also paid a civil monetary penalty of $ 303 million for attempting to manipulate the propane market -LRB- 2004 -RRB- . The settlement beguilingly concluded `` all criminal investigations of BP America on matters related to propane , gasoline , crude oil and other commodity trading '' , implying the CFTC was looking at other issues as well . The incidents may or may not reflect shortcomings in management and culture . Maybe the company has just been unlucky . But the number of them in quick succession is beginning to look disturbing . Rightly or wrongly , BP North America is being singled out by U.S. officials as a problematic part of the industry . Deepwater drilling will undoubtedly resume , under a tougher inspection regime . But BP may cede ground to its less accident-prone peers and will come under fierce pressure to change its operating and management practices . It is that fear markets are reflecting with the collapse in the share price . The direct costs of the clean up are only one of the company 's problems . BP 's number one priority now is to make sure that the next time a well blows , it belongs to someone else . There are similarities as well as differences between Deepwater Horizon and Three Mile Island . The similarities involve the powers that be lying after the fact to downplay the extent of their respective disasters and the enormity of ensuing long-term effects , which would lead one to conclude that similarly casual -LRB- when it comes to the lives of others -RRB- individuals are in charge of both situations at corporate and government levels", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "BP 's market capitalization has taken a hit of 40% due to the catastrophic blowout at Macondo, and analysts are speculating about long-term reductions in deepwater drilling and its impact on oil supply and climate change legislation.", "prop_score_1": 0.5, "generate_explanation_1": "The incident at Macondo has sparked intense public scrutiny, raising concerns about the safety of deepwater drilling and the potential long-term effects on oil supply and climate change legislation.

Top members of the Obama administration stated Thursday their desire for embattled Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to leave office and for inclusive negotiations to begin immediately with his political opponents . `` `` We 're working behind the scenes on ways to move that process forward , '' National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor said . But Vietor stressed `` all of those decisions must be made by the Egyptian people . '' A senior Obama administration official knocked down a New York Times report that the Egyptians and Americans were near consensus on a specific proposal . Egypt losing a lot of money Hosni Mubarak : In his words Crowley : We 're worried about the media Camera rolls as Cooper , crew attacked `` It 's simply wrong to report that there 's a single U.S. plan that 's being negotiated with the Egyptians , '' the official said . U.S. officials have made clear in recent days their desire to jumpstart talks between opposition and ruling forces in order to lay the groundwork as soon as possible for a governmental transition . That includes pressuring , besides Mubarak 's government , opposition groups to engage immediately in talks . Mubarak has announced he will not seek re-election in September . Protesters , however , continue to demand that he step down immediately , with a caretaker unity government running the country until the fall elections . While some , like former Foreign Minister and Arab League Secretary General Amr Moussa , believe concessions made by Mubarak presented an opportunity to build upon , members of the opposition Muslim Brotherhood have insisted no talks should take place until the president leaves office . `` It 's time for both of them to roll up their sleeves , '' a senior State Department official said . `` The government has to take some steps , but the opposition has to be willing to participate in negotiations as well . '' Egyptian Vice President Omar Suleiman made `` important statements '' about a political dialogue , the senior official said . Still , he added that the Egyptian government should allow the opposition to bring its own ideas , rather than dictate the pace and scope of a transformation to democracy . The urgent call for talks comes as the Egyptian government pushed back on what it described as `` vague '' statements from the Obama administration about the pace of transition . An Egyptian government official told CNN the White House has shown support for its `` roadmap '' for a transition up to when Mubarak 's term ends in September , but said President Obama 's calls for an `` orderly transition '' are at odds with his call for an immediate one . The official said Mubarak is seen as a `` receding figure '' in Egyptian politics , but warned that deposing him immediately would lead to a murky political process that would make free and fair elections difficult . According to the Egyptian constitution , the presidency would be transferred to the speaker of the parliament if Mubarak leaves power without enacting certain legislative and constitutional reforms . `` Institutionally , there is support in Egypt for this roadmap among the military , vice president and prime minister , '' said the Egyptian official . Egypt : Lay of the land Will the Egyptian crisis ever end ? U.S. officials said they believe what transpires Friday -- when another massive anti-government protest is expected -- will be an important barometer on whether serious negotiations can take place . Demonstrators may be less willing to talk if attacked . `` It 's hard to imagine if there is a day of very bad violence , it will lead to the type of dialogue that needs to take place , '' the senior State Department official said . These backroom discussions involving the U.S. and Egyptian political players come as the White House and legislators stepped up their public pressure on Mubarak 's regime . On Thursday , Vice President Joe Biden talked with Suleiman and pressed him that `` credible , inclusive negotiations -LRB- should -RRB- begin immediately '' with opposition political groups , a statement from Biden 's office said . That sentiment was reiterated by White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs , who told reporters `` it is important that we all begin to see meaningful steps , and that negotiations take place between the -LRB- current -RRB- government and a broadly based group of members of the opposition as we work through the transition toward free and fair elections . '' U.S. lawmakers have also chimed in , with foreign policy veterans Sens. John Kerry , D-Massachusetts , and John McCain , R-Arizona , among those calling for Mubarak to step aside for the sake of his country and people . Thursday night , the U.S. Senate gave unanimous approval to a resolution calling for Mubarak to `` immediately begin an orderly and peaceful transition to a democratic political system , including the transfer of power to an inclusive interim caretaker government , in coordination with leaders from Egypt 's opposition , civil society , and military , to enact the necessary reforms to hold free , fair , and internationally credible elections this year . '' The Obama administration also sharply condemned the violence that erupted Wednesday in Cairo , when pro-Mubarak supporters attacked anti-government protesters . At least eight people were killed and 836 injured , according to the Egyptian Health Ministry . State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley said Thursday `` elements close to the government or ruling party '' carried out the violence . `` I do n't think we have a sense of how far up the chain it went , '' he noted . The United States continues to walk a fine diplomatic line in the crisis , encouraging Mubarak to transition from power while stopping short of publicly asking him to step down . Officials say the restraint is needed because the White House is mindful that allies in the Middle East are concerned about American loyalty . Government contacts have expressed reservations about how vocal the Obama administration has been in pressing Mubarak , a close American ally of three decades . Other regional allies are concerned about how quickly the United States might turn on them if protests start in their countries , the State Department officials said . The White House , meanwhile , has made a deliberate decision to let Adm. Mike Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , take the lead role in communicating with the Egyptian military about its role in the current unrest , according to two senior U.S. officials . Mullen has not told Egyptian military leaders to pressure Mubarak to step down , the officials insisted to CNN . `` That 's not his role , '' one official said . Mullen is , however , trying to push the Egyptian military to maintain security , not move against peaceful protesters , and keep the violence from escalating . The U.S. government believes Mubarak will not issue a direct order to the Egyptian army to do anything because he is uncertain his orders would be followed , one official with very direct knowledge of evolving U.S. policy in the crisis told CNN . A refusal on the part of the army to obey Mubarak would spell the end of the Egyptian leader 's rule , the official noted . At that point , Mubarak would have to leave the country . The U.S. belief right now , the official said , is that Suleiman is letting the army feel it is `` representing the flag of the nation '' in trying to help without making a massive move against the government . While Mullen is communicating with his Egyptian counterparts , the CIA has set up its own task force to monitor the crisis . `` The Central Intelligence Agency always surges personnel and resources as needed to meet any crisis head-on . This situation is no different , and we 've established a Middle East Task Force , '' CIA spokeswoman Jennifer Youngblood said . `` Our 24\\/7 operations are focused on", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "An Egyptian official chastises the U.S. for \"vague\" statements on the transition, while U.S. officials work behind the scenes to move the political process forward.", "prop_score_1": 0.5, "generate_explanation_1": "The Egyptian official criticizes the U.S. for lacking clarity in its statements about the transition, while U.S. officials are working secretly to facilitate negotiations between opposition and ruling forces.

Ambassador to the United States , Moammar Gadhafi , said Tuesday that the U.S.-led international community has joined the international community in calling for an immediate end to the violence in the country . `` We have joined the Libyan people in demanding that Gadhafi must go -- now , without further violence or delay -- and we are working to translate the world 's outrage into action and results , '' Secretary of State Hillary Clinton told the House Foreign Affairs Committee . The Obama administration is considering whether it should cut diplomatic ties with Libya , a senior U.S. official told CNN . `` Whether to maintain relations or sever them is under review , '' the official said . U.S. officials have said all options are being considered with respect to Libya . Underscoring that point , the amphibious assault ship USS Kearsarge and the amphibious transport dock USS Ponce were to be repositioned in the Mediterranean to `` provide us a capability for both emergency evacuations and also for humanitarian relief , '' Defense Secretary Robert Gates told reporters . But , he noted , the U.N. Security Council has not authorized the use of armed force . The U.N. General Assembly adopted by consensus a resolution to suspend Libya from its seat on the 47-member chamber Human Rights Council . It was the first time the assembly had suspended a member of the council . `` This is a harsh rebuke -- but one that Libya 's leaders have brought down upon themselves , '' said Ambassador Susan E. Rice , U.S. permanent representative to the United Nations , in a statement . U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon told the General Assembly that he welcomed the decision and urged the international community to investigate allegations of human rights violations in Libya . `` The world has spoken with one voice , '' he said . `` We demand an immediate end to the violence toward civilians and full respect for their fundamental human rights , including those of peaceful assembly and free speech . '' Should U.S. arm Libyan rebels ? U.N. fears refugee crisis in Libya Guns and oil in rebel controlled Libya Libyan protests : Raw and online He added that reports from the ground `` are sobering , '' with continuing loss of life and ongoing repression . `` Arms depots and arsenals have reportedly been opened to gangs who terrorize communities , '' he said . `` There are reports that government forces have fired indiscriminately on peaceful protesters and bombed the military bases in the east of the country . '' `` The death toll from nearly two weeks of violence is unknown , but likely to exceed 1,000 , '' with thousands more wounded , Ban said , using the same fatality figure he had used Friday . Libya 's ambassador to the United States estimated Monday that the death toll was about 2,000 . But Gates stressed the number of casualties is uncertain . `` I think the honest answer is that we do n't know , '' he told reporters . The government of Canada has frozen $ 2.3 billion in assets tied to the Libyan government ; the assets were frozen after Canada enacted sanctions over the weekend , Canadian Foreign Affairs spokeswoman Lynn Meahan said Tuesday . A number of other countries , including the United States , have ordered an asset freeze . Though some witnesses have accused pro-Gadhafi forces of firing on civilians from the air , Gates and Michael Mullen , chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , said they could not confirm the reports . What are U.S. options for Libya ? Clinton said imposition of a no-fly zone is under consideration , but Mullen said doing so would be `` an extraordinarily complex operation . '' A top U.S. general said Tuesday that any effort to establish a no-fly zone over the country would include eliminating Libya 's air defenses . It would be `` challenging , '' U.S. Central Command leader Gen. James Mattis told the Senate Armed Services committee . In western Libya , Ban said , there were reports of ongoing clashes between government forces and armed opponents . He noted `` allegations of extrajudicial killings , arbitrary arrests , detentions and torture . '' Though more members of the military have reportedly sided with the opposition , Gadhafi 's supporters `` appear to be holding a tight grip on western parts of the country , chiefly Tripoli , '' he said . He warned of `` serious indications '' that the numbers of refugees and displaced persons were reaching crisis proportions and worried that the violence could disrupt distribution networks and lead to food shortages . The U.N. refugee agency reported that nearly 150,000 people had crossed Libya 's borders into Egypt and Tunisia and thousands more were arriving hourly at the borders . Ban called for immediate action by the international community . `` Time is of the essence , '' he said . `` Thousands of lives are at stake . '' Indeed , at the border with Tunisia , many recent arrivals said they had been robbed or forced to pay bribes en route . Some said they had been threatened with death . One man said Libyan soldiers used electric cables to beat him as he waited at the airport and demanded $ 500 from him . When he told them he did n't have it , they said , `` Die then '' and threw him into the street . Tunisian authorities appeared to be struggling to cope with the arriving wave of refugees . Volunteers hurled fresh bread and water into the crowds . `` There is nothing for them on that side , '' a policeman turned volunteer said from the Tunisian side of the border . He was one of many Tunisians donating their time to take food , water and supplies to the border . Many said they were livid that international organizations were slow in arriving . Meanwhile , more parts of the regime have broken off , joining calls for Gadhafi to halt the violence . In London , the Libyan Embassy said it was siding with the opposition , condemning what it called `` all acts of murder and terror '' taking place in Libya . The military situation on the ground was complex : Forces loyal to Gadhafi tried to retake a town near the capital that is under opposition control but were repelled , an opposition leader in the town told CNN Tuesday . The source said pro-Gadhafi troops with tanks and anti-aircraft guns attacked Zawiya from east and west at nightfall Monday , but did not capture the town . A senior official in Gadhafi 's regime denied that government forces attacked rebels in Zawiya . Senior members of the government told CNN that Zawiya and Misrata are key to their effort to regain control of the country . The officials insisted they want a peaceful resolution , but witnesses have described repeated violent efforts by the regime to regain control of areas Gadhafi has lost . Zawiya was calm Tuesday , but Gadhafi 's troops remained nearby , the opposition leader and another source in the town said . CNN is not naming them to protect their safety . Misrata was protected by its residents and military defectors and the situation there on Tuesday was stable , said Abd al Baset Imzeereq , who identified himself as the spokesman for the newly formed city council . Pro-Gadhafi forces are stationed in the Navy college about 15 kilometers -LRB- nine miles -RRB- outside the city and have not attempted to move into the city center since its fall , he said . The forces appear to be stationed there not to try to retake the city , but to protect the ammunition depot in the college and `` to terrorize the people '' by opening fire on them . At least two farmers were killed Monday when these forces shot at their vehicle , Imzeereq said . Still , some semblance of normalcy was visible Tuesday , when some banks had reopened in Misrata and people were able to withdraw money or get loans , he said . Food supplies were ample , he said , but medical goods were scarce . Imzeereq said at least 33 have been killed and another 487 wounded in Misrata since the unrest began . The capital city of Tripoli was quiet Tuesday as more people here also tried to resume normal life . Prices of basic goods have increased ; a Tripoli resident said she could not get paid due to unspecified problems in her bank . Some residents told CNN they want to protest but fear being killed .

The price of stalemate is rising daily : sectarian mayhem , a growing protest movement and a faltering economy , with no sign that Bashar and his minority Alawite clan are considering an exit strategy after four decades in power . Yet so far , there is no sign of a tipping point that would assure success for protesters , as in Tunisia and Egypt , where millions took to the streets to topple autocratic leaders . `` The situation has not reached a critical mass , '' said Patrick Seale , biographer of Bashar 's father , Hafez al-Assad . `` Damascus has n't risen , the security services have n't split yet , the economy has n't collapsed . The regime looks weak and the opposition looks weaker , '' he said . Analysts say the Homs killings were provoked by a ferocious security clampdown . `` More than 100 bodies had been found , '' Bashar al-Assad said in a televised address . The Alawite sect , an off-shoot of Shi'ite Islam , is a minority in Syria , which has a Sunni Muslim majority , as well as smaller numbers of Druze , Christians and non-Arab Kurds . A group of Alawite men , including four security men , went missing on July 14 . The bodies of four of them were found killed . Some Alawites from their neighbourood in Homs took to the streets , torched and destroyed shops belonging to Sunnis . The danger of sectarian strife is real , analysts say . It might even appeal to the authorities -- and some of their opponents -- as a way to break the deadlock . But it carries high risks for the Assad dynasty , as well as the opposition . `` This is a dangerous strategy for a regime trying to survive , '' said Eugene Rogan , director of the Middle East Centre at Oxford University . `` You watch your army disintegrate if sectarianism becomes an issue . '' Analysts say the Homs killings were provoked by a ferocious security clampdown , including the arrest , disappearance and torture to death of hundreds of men . Islamists , long persecuted by the security forces , have their own axe to grind . `` The security solution has n't worked . The regime has decided to go for civil strife because it senses that it is losing . The protests are spilling over and spreading to the capital , '' said a Damascus-based Arab journalist who declined to be named . Alawite villagers say authorities have been arming young men to fight the insurgency . Mutilated bodies of some Shabbiha men , handed over by security forces to their families for burial , served to incite sectarian hatred in those villages . Sectarian paranoia is evident , with Assad trusting only two elite units commanded by his brother Maher -- the 4th Armoured Division and the Republican Guard -- as well as secret police and Alawite militia , known as Shabbiha , to deal with dissent . `` The coherence -LRB- of the security forces -RRB- is already in question . Sectarianism is already a problem , the loyalty of other units can not be counted on , '' Rogan said . While the authorities blame the upheaval on a `` bunch of Islamists , '' the reality appears more complex . Some Syria-watchers say the protest movement is driven mainly by youths and includes rural Sunni tribes , nationalists , leftists , secularists and also Islamists , united in their goal of overthrowing an autocratic and corrupt government . Geographically , the protests have spread since March to many rural and tribal regions , cities such as Hama and Homs , and even to Damascus , although not on a huge scale in the capital . Security forces and Shabbiha militiamen , armed with metal bars , are everywhere . The army has deployed tanks around the main cities to keep out protesters from the countryside . `` The savagery of the regime has increased 180 degrees . The hostility against it has massively increased too among ordinary people , not just protesters . There are widescale arrests in all areas , in cities and villages , '' the Syrian journalist said . Residents said the Alawite units , though overstretched , have stepped up their offensive and are showing resilience in facing the growing demonstrations . The protest movement , however , is growing and showing no sign of dying down , residents add . In a country where once no one dared utter a word against the president , chants such as : `` Bashar you butcher we wo n't rest until we bury you '' show how fearless the activists have become . Graffiti on rubbish bins read : `` Bashar : this is your final grave . '' Toppling the system , analysts say , is hazardous because of Syria 's power structure under which Alawites hold key posts in the military and Assad family insiders run the key security bodies , tying senior officers closely to Assad 's own fate . Sarkis Naoum , an expert on Syrian affairs , said Assad was not likely to be overthrown quickly , but the conflict could develop into a bloody civil war . `` It is not clear how it would evolve and how much time it would take . The regime can not win and also the opposition can not win either , '' said Naoum , a columnist at Beirut 's an-Nahar daily . What complicates the Syrian scene is that the Assads will fight to the end rather than leave because they fear that their family and their sect would be targeted under Sunni rule . `` The Assads wo n't relinquish power . They are refusing reform because it will make them have to give up power , '' Naoum said . Rogan said that Assad 's departure was not imminent . `` It is a long way before we reach the point where Bashar has to go . The regime is a lot stronger than people like to think but Assad is weak and has no sense of leadership . '' The protests have virtually crippled Damascus . Shops open for a few hours during the day and close early . Business activity is grounded and many people have lost their jobs . The city , which once buzzed with night life , is tense and eerie after dark . Signs of stretched resources and a strained economy are very evident . The Syrian economy could prove to be Assad 's curse . With no end in sight to the crackdown on protesters , the country 's key revenue streams look shattered . A more marked decline in Syria 's economic health may force the regime to fall . After growing at an average of 5 percent over the last five years , the economy is forecast to contract as much as 3 percent this year as tourism , which accounts for 23 percent of Syria 's hard currency earnings , and foreign investment grind to a halt . With hotels almost empty and the growing likelihood of oil sanctions , Syria is desperately trying to retain local and foreign currency by increasing interest rates on deposits and curbing foreign currency sales . Tehran , which regards Syria as a close ally in a mainly Sunni-dominated region suspicious of non-Arab Shi'ite Iran , is reported to have come to his help in funds and expertise . Iran is considering offering $ 5.8 billion -LRB- 3.5 billion pound -RRB- in financial help , French business newspaper Les Echos said . Iran , which quashed its own pro-democracy youth movement after President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad 's re-election in 2009 , has sent experts to help the Syrian authorities monitor and jam satellite communication and the Internet , according to Ausama Monajed of the Syrian opposition . The opposition said the government had been finding it hard to monitor the activists ' communications until the Iranians stepped in , providing authorities with Chinese and North Korean equipment to intercept and eavesdrop on conversations . Monajed , spokesman for the Syrian opposition in Europe , said the opposition is lobbying to raise funds and rally world opinion to slap more sanctions against Assad and his aides .

You have asked me for advice on the legality of military action against Iraq without a further resolution of the Security Council . This is , of course , a matter we have discussed before . Since then , I have had the benefit of discussions with the Foreign Secretary and Sir Jeremy Greenstock -LRB- the then British ambassador to the UN -RRB- , who have given me valuable background information on the negotiating history of resolution 1441 . In addition , I have also had the opportunity to hear the views of the US Administration from their perspective as co-sponsors of the resolution . This note considers the issues in detail in order that you are in a position to understand the legal reasoning . My conclusions are summarised at paragraphs 26 to 31 below . Possible legal bases for the use of force : 2 . As I have previously advised , there are generally three possible bases for the use of force : -LRB- a -RRB- self-defence -LRB- which may include collective self-defence -RRB- ; -LRB- b -RRB- exceptionally , to avert overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe ; and -LRB- c -RRB- authorisation by the Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter . Force may be used in self-defence if there is an actual or imminent threat of an armed attack ; the use of force must be necessary , ie the only means of averting an attack ; and the force used must be a proportionate response . It is now widely accepted that an imminent armed attack will justify the use of force if the other conditions are met . The concept of what is imminent may depend on the circumstances . Different considerations may apply , for example , where the risk is of attack from terrorists sponsored or harboured by a particular State , or where there is a threat of an attack by nuclear weapons . However , in my opinion there must be some degree of imminence . I am aware that the USA has been arguing for recognition of a broad doctrine of a right to use force to pre-empt danger in the future . If this means more than a right to respond proportionately to an imminent attack -LRB- and I understand that the doctrine is intended to carry that connotation -RRB- this is not a doctrine which , in my opinion , exists or is recognized in international law . The use of force to avert overwhelming humanitarian catastrophe has been emerging as a further , and exceptional , basis for the use of force . It was relied on by the UK in the Kosovo crisis and is the underlying justification for the No-Fly Zones . The doctrine remains controversial , however . I know of no reason why it would be an appropriate basis for action in present circumstances . Force may be used where this authorised -LRB- sic -RRB- by the UN Security Council acting under Chapter VII of the UN Charter . The key question is whether resolution 1441 has the effect of providing such authorisation . As you are aware , the argument that resolution 1441 itself provides the authorisation to use force depends on the revival of the express authorisation to use force given in 1990 by Security Council resolution 678 . This in turn gives rise to two questions : -LRB- a -RRB- is the so-called `` revival argument '' a sound legal basis in principle ? -LRB- b -RRB- is resolution 1441 sufficient to revive the authorisation in resolution 678 ? I deal with these questions in turn . It is a trite , but nonetheless relevant observation given what some commentators have been saying , that f the answer to these two questions is `` yes '' , the use of force will have been authorised by the United Nations and not in defiance of it . Following its invasion and annexation of Kuwait , the Security Council authorised the use of force against Iraq in resolution 678 -LRB- 1990 -RRB- . This resolution authorised coalition forces to use all necessary means to force Iraq to withdraw from Kuwait and to restore international eace and security in the area . The resolution gave a legal basis for Operation Desert Storm , which was brought to an end by the ceasefire set out by the Council in resolution 687 -LRB- 1991 -RRB- . The conditions for the ceasefire in that resolution -LRB- and subsequent resolutions -RRB- imposed obligations on Iraq with regard to the elimination of WMD and monitoring of its obligations . Resolution 687 suspended , but did not terminate , the authority to use force in resolution 678 . Nor has any subsequent resolution terminated the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 . It has been the UK 's view that a violation of Iraq 's obligations under resolution 687 which is sufficiently serious to undermine the basis of the ceasefire can revive the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 . In reliance on this argument , force has been used on certain occasions . I am advised by the Foreign Office Legal Advisers that this was the basis for the use of force between 13 and 18 January 1993 following UN Presidential Statements on 8 and 11 January 1993 condemning particular failures by Iraq to observe the terms of the ceasefire resolution . The revival argument was also the basis for the use of force in December 1998 by the US and UK -LRB- Operation Desert Fox -RRB- . This followed a series of Security Council resolutions , notably resolution 1205 -LRB- 1998 -RRB- . Law Officers have advised in the past that , provided the conditions are made out , the revival argument does provide a sufficient justification in international law for the use of force against Iraq . That view is supported by an opinion given in August 1992 by the then UN Legal Counsel , Carl-August Fleischauer . However , the UK has consistently taken the view -LRB- as did the Fleischauer opinion -RRB- that , as the ceasefire conditions were set by the Security Council in resolution 687 , it is for the Council to assess whether any such breach of those obligations has occurred . The US have a rather different view : they maintain that the fact of whether Iraq is in breach is a matter of objective fact which may therefore be assessed by individual Member States . I am not aware of any other state which supports this view . This is an issue of critical importance when considering the effect of resolution 1441 . The revival argument is controversial . It is not widely accepted among academic commentators . However , I agree with my predecessors ' advice on this issue . Further , I believe that the arguments in support of the revival argument are stronger following adoption of resolution 1441 . That is because of the terms of the resolution and the course of the negotiations which led to its adoption . Thus , preambular paragraphs 4 , 5 and 10 recall the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 and that resolution 687 imposed obligations on Iraq as a necessary condition of the ceasefire . Operative paragraph -LRB- OP -RRB- 1 provides that Iraq has been and remains in material breach of its obligations under relevant resolutions , including the resolution 687 . OP13 recalls that Iraq has been warned repeatedly that `` serious consequences '' will result from continued violations of its obligations . The previous practice of the Council and statements made by Council members during the negotiation of resolution 1441 demonstrate that the phrase `` material breach '' signifies a finding by the Council of a sufficiently serious breach of the cease-fire conditions to revive the authorisation in resolution 678 and that `` serious consequences '' is accepted as indicating the use of force . I disagree , therefore , with those commentators and lawyers , who assert that nothing less than an explicit -LRB- underlined -RRB- authorisation to use force in a Security Council resolution will be sufficient . In order for the authorisation to use force in resolution 678 to be revived , there needs to be a determination by the Security Council that there is a violation of the conditions of the ceasefire and that the Security Council considers it sufficiently serious to destroy the basis of the ceasefire . Revival will not , however , take place , notwithstanding a finding of violation , if the Security Council has made it clear either that action short of the use of force should be", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "The full text of the advice on the legality of military action against Iraq given by the Attorney General to the Prime Minister on March 7, 2003, has been provided.", "prop_score_1": 0.7, "generate_explanation_1": "The advice focuses on three legal bases for the use of force: self-defense, humanitarian intervention, and authorization by the UN Security Council.

BECKY ANDERSON , CONNECT THE WORLD , CNN : United in prayer and in protest . Tens of thousands keep Egypt uprising against their president alive before an 11th day . The Friday of departure has n't quite worked out . President Hosni Mubarak is still in office with an hour to go until midnight . From Cairo 's Tahrir Square to these jubilant demonstrators of Alexandria there is no giving up . ANDERSON : We 're going to go live to Cairo in just in a moment first . We want to show you what a difference a day makes in Egypt uprising after clashes this week killed at least 11 people in Tahrir Square . Many fear the worse for this Friday . The mood was far different . Protestors were festered happy to have held their ground and hopeful the change is just around the corner . ANDERSON : As light broke across Tahrir Square this morning a sense of anticipation filled the air for what many dubbed the day of departure . Government troops in circled the square early after two days of bloody battles between pro and anti-Mubarak protestors . Security check points was set up to search the 10s of 1000s of people before they were allowed in . By 9:00 in the morning the square was getting full . People who stayed overnight shared breakfast with one another . Many brought in their own supplies . Next to them piles of rocks in case fighting broke out . According to our reporters there the mood early on was largely optimistic and peaceful . Egyptians stood side by side singing and dancing . Many chanting for Mubarak to finally leave . At noon , the crowd kneeled for Friday prayers momentarily transferring the square into a place of worship . Many of our CNN correspondents were tweeting photos from the demonstrations . These photos from Fred Pleitgen showed crowds chanting and waving flags . The demos were largely festive for most of the day . But by 6:00 p.m. local time there were reports of running battles between pro and anti- Mubarak protestors . Gun fire could be heard in the air on the outskirts of Tahrir Square but it last for only a few minutes . As night fell , 10s of 1000s still remain determined to see through their demands to the end . ANDERSON : Well before we go live to Cairo a lot -LRB- INAUDIBLE -RRB- this hour reports the US wants Mubarak out immediately . We 're going to go to Washington for more on that and ask an expert why he thinks that might be a bad idea . The role of the Muslim Brotherhood remains crucial . Ayan Hirsi Ali will tell us how she was once a part of that group and what they 'll mean to Egypt 's future . And later the bigger picture , were going to explore what people in the region have been asking for and what they are really getting . This is the 11th day of protest in Egypt drew to a close demonstrators got a new promise the government . Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik says force will not be used to clear Tahrir Square . Well let 's get the latest on these situations on the ground . Arwa Damon joins us from the Cairo . ARWA DAMON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Hi Becky . Well part of the reason that we did see that relatively speaking a sense of calm over Tahrir Square despite the clashes that happen on some of the side streets is because throughout the day he Egyptian military did maintain a much heavier presence that anything that we had seen in the past . They were blocking off some of the major routes leading to the square . And we did see the pro-Mubarak group keeping their distance . But that at around 10:00 pm local time around an hour ago we also saw the military with a drop on some of those positions handful of pro-Mubarak groups moving in taking up their usual positions on one of the over passes leading to the square . And despite that their presence was absence in Tahrir Square it felt for the most part it most certainly was felt once a person ventured past the square as we did today . We came across small gatherings of pro-Mubarak demonstrators . We squirted past them for the simple reason that it was by in large the pro- Mubarak groups that were those who were attacking the media . And at this point , it does really appear that attempt to truly diffuse this crisis have fallen flat . The opposition groups denied be by President for political to meet with him over the last few days . There is talk of a group of wise man as its being dubbed up trying to form some sort of an agreement between the opposition and between the governments . And although speaking relatively of course from the last few nights there is this sense of calm . There is always that overriding concern that violence could erupt at any moment . When we have an interrupt it has happen immediately , suddenly and very surprisingly Becky . ANDERSON : All right . Arwa Damon on the ground there in Cairo . Let 's bring in anti-government demonstrator . He 's become a regular contributor to our show over the past week or so . Gigi Ibrahim has been protesting in Tahrir Square right from the start and she joins us now on the line from Cairo . How are things at this point ? We just heard from Arwa . What 's the mood in an hour to go until midnight ? GIGI IBRAHIM , PROTESTOR : The mood is really different today considering the violence that we had in the past two days . Really a lot of people turn out today to for the Friday prayer and it was such an amazing , beautiful , emotional scene . People were praying and crying for those who died since really the revolution has started and there 's a lot of self-organization . You can witness coming into Tahrir you were searched maybe by 10 times by just the volunteers and average citizens who are taking up this role on themselves to make sure that there are not violent intruders within in the Tahrir Square . ANDERSON : Gigi you think part of what is being quite a remarkable people 's revolution as it were . At this point on the 11th day what sort of progress do you feel that you made ? IBRAHIM : Excuse me , I did n't hear you . ANDERSON : What sort of progress do you think you 've made given that Mubarak is still in Egypt ? IBRAHIM : I think the progress is really Egypt had you know gained its self-confidence again . The people , the people have this sense of pride and honor of being Egyptian and that is reflecting in every part in Egypt . You look at the neighborhoods being protected by its own citizens . And in some sense we taken control back of our country and that 's putting a lot of pressure on Mubarak and making those people demand in Tahrir Square even more powerful . And the world is completely watching and supporting - and completely supporting the Egyptian people . From all the messages have been receiving over you know the course of this whole thing and it 's truly , truly remarkable . ANDERSON : And yet the demands from protestors , well there 's simply one demand is n't there , that Mubarak go . He is still there . IBRAHIM : What happens is that really the people over in Tahrir Square will not leave . The determination is persistent and of staying there until Mubarak officially steps down . Everybody is you know knows that his time is over . Like he 's obviously not going to continue to be in power but the more people stay in Tahrir Square and the more violence and the more people that die because of the whole revolution it makes the people more and more determine to fight for freedom and justice and human dignity really by demanding and being more persistent for Mubarak to step down now and not in September . ANDERSON : The pictures and crowds have been quite remarkable but if he were n't to go - I mean are you confident that he will go ? And if he does n't go will you continue to protest ?

ELIOT SPITZER , CNN ANCHOR : Good evening and welcome to the show . I 'm Eliot Spitzer . Kathleen Parker is on assignment tonight . She 's in Washington and in just a moment she 'll be with us with breaking news , an exclusive one-on-one interview with speaker of the House , John Boehner . We 'll get his first comments on last night 's State of the Union speech and he had some strong things to say . But first I wanted to give you my thoughts on what the president told the American people last night . Some of it , I liked , some of it , not so much . Let 's start with this simple idea . Give the president some credit . He saved us from a depression . He brought back the auto industry . He added a million private sector jobs in the past year . And still everybody out there seems to want to give him hell . Everyone is a critic . Give him a break for a minute and listen to what he said . Because last night he told us the single most essential truth about what we need to do . We 've got to lift our game . In a world driven by technology and tough competition , we need to be better educated , more creative . The president set out a challenge . If we want to stay competitive , we had better invest in our educational skills , in infrastructure , in energy independence . But then he dropped the ball . After setting out the challenge , the president fumbled . He did n't answer the critical question . How do we do it ? How do we pay for it ? Last fall I think he made a big mistake . He extended the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy . Some saw it as a compromise . I saw it as caving . It added hundreds of billions of dollars to the deficit . If he 'd only told us how he wants to pay for his grand ambitions , a good speech could have been a great speech . Now still to come tonight , a stormy White House , not politically , aesthetically . Take a look at those pictures . It is a thing of beauty and it 's happening again in New York and Boston , another major winter storm . And elsewhere in the world , Egypt explodes as thousands storm the streets demanding the ouster of their longtime president and threatening the stability of a key U.S. ally . But first it 's time for Kathleen 's exclusive interview with John Boehner . KATHLEEN PARKER , CNN ANCHOR : All right , thanks so much , Eliot . And thank you , Speaker Boehner , for making time for us . I know you 're a busy man these days . REP. JOHN BOEHNER -LRB- R -RRB- , HOUSE SPEAKER : Glad to be here with you . PARKER : All right . Let 's cut straight to the State of the Union address last night . The president kept saying this is a Sputnik moment . What kind of moment would you say we 're in right now ? BOEHNER : Well , if you really want to talk about what the Sputnik moment is , it 's the fact that we 're broke . BOEHNER : The American people know we 're broke and they want us to do something about spending . And there was n't much talk last night about cutting spending and getting our debt under control . PARKER : And would you cut Medicare and Medicaid and Social Security ? BOEHNER : If we lead with our chin , nothing happens . That 's what 's happened in Washington for the last 25 years . I think that we need to have both parties working together to help explain to the American people the size of the problem and an array of possible solutions and out of that conversation we 'll begin to resolve what is possible . PARKER : All right . Well , let 's just focus on one piece of it . Let 's look at Social Security . Speaker Boehner , you have said that you would support or consider supporting raising the retirement age for Social Security . Would you go on record tonight and say that you will do that ? BOEHNER : I do n't -- I made a mistake when I did that because I think having the conversation about how big the problem is is the first step . And once the American people understand how big the problem is , then you can begin to outline an array of possible solutions . But when you look at life expectancy in America today and you look at the Social Security system , we 're all living far longer than anyone had ever anticipated and the result of these big demographic changes is having a disastrous effect on the Social Security program . And so raising the retirement age or considering it is something that ought to be on the table . PARKER : OK , so raising the retirement age is on the table . And you keep saying -- Speaker Boehner , you keep talking about an adult conversation . And nobody really -- yes , we have to have one . Everyone I 've talked to , I ca n't -- most people say , look , even -- Obama 's plans , even the plans that the Republicans have put forward , there 's really no way to get out of this economic mess without these drastic spending cuts that we 're talking about , cutting back on entitlements but also raising taxes . Ultimately are we going to have to raise taxes ? BOEHNER : Raising taxes is the wrong prescription for where we are . It 's pretty clear to me the cutting of spending is the most important thing we can do to get the American people back to work . That and eliminating a lot of the uncertainty of this coming out of this administration . The most important thing we can do to increase federal revenues is to get the American people back to work . Whether they 're taking care of themselves , their families and back on the tax rolls helping to supply income to the federal government to meet the demands of the American people . You 're not going to get people back to work by taxing the very people that we expected to reinvest in our economy . PARKER : Now we are talking about a debt and deficit of enormous proportions and I do n't know how you can cut enough without also raising taxes . BOEHNER : You ca n't raise -- PARKER : Believe me , I do n't want to pay more taxes . BOEHNER : You do n't -- you ca n't raise enough to solve the problem . And you ca n't spend -- you ca n't cut enough spending to solve this problem . Two things have to happen if we 're serious . We 've got to hold the line on spending and we have to get the American people back to work . PARKER : Last night after the State of the Union address , Michele Bachmann got up and gave her own response . Now she did this without consulting you . You 're the most powerful man in the House of Representatives certainly and one of the top -- most powerful men in the nation . And she decides to go out on her own and give a response . Are you able to manage these people ? BOEHNER : Well , the official -- the official response was given by Paul Ryan , who 's chosen by Senator McConnell and I , to give our response . But understand that every member of Congress , Democrat and Republican , does a response to the State of the Union . I mean in years past I 've been on a number of TV shows , I 've done a number radio programs back in my district . Everyone does something to respond to the State of the Union .

{"doc_id": "/shared/nas/data/m1/khhuang3/disinformation_correction/timeline17/bpoil_reuters/rsd/bpoil_reuters__2010-12-01__38.rsd.txt.app-auth-final", "news_label": 0, "original_txt": "LONDON | Wed Dec 1 , 2010 8:28 am EST LONDON -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Last month , BP increased by $ 8 billion the financial provisions it was taking for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill ; the company 's shares rose . Better-than - expected underlying profits and upbeat comments from new Chief Executive Bob Dudley were taken by the market as a sign the company had turned the corner and would soon return to pumping out steadily rising dividends . Key to this sanguine outlook is confidence that the new estimate of the total cost of the spill -- $ 40 billion -- will be sufficient . `` We think that $ 40 billion adequately provisions for the liabilities that are outstanding so far , '' said Mark Lacey , Fund Manager at Investec Global Energy Fund . Paul Mumford , fund manager at Cavendish Asset Management , went further , saying the provision is likely to be overly conservative : `` You might well find that you get provision write-backs , '' he said , hinting the bill could be lower . That optimistic view may turn out to be true . Mr Mumford said : `` I think it would be good news for BP if it does turn out to be true , but I do n't think it will be . `` There could be provision write-backs , '' Zygmunt Plater , Boston College Law School , said . But history shows there is ample scope for nasty surprises from BP . The London-based oil giant -- last year it was the biggest non-state controlled oil and gas producer in the world -- has so far consistently underestimated the scope and potential cost of the Gulf spill . It also has a track record of low-balling disasters , including the fatal Texas City refinery blast in 2005 . Not only has the company underestimated the cost of repairing equipment and ecosystems in the past , it has also made overly optimistic assumptions about legal challenges . That may be happening again . CEO Dudley , an American who took over from Briton Tony Hayward in October , has said a $ 20 billion fund BP created to compensate victims of the spill should cover all damages claims . The lawyers who are suing BP do n't think so . `` The total value of the claims already registered could exceed the amount of money that has been dedicated to pay the fund , '' said Texas-based trial lawyer Brent Coon , who represents victims of the explosion and subsequent spill and who was prominent in litigation against BP after Texas City . `` Then you have the claims that have not been filed yet , and claims from those indirectly impacted , and shareholder derivative claims ... You have very large potential claims that could , in total , be exponentially greater than the amount set aside . '' Zygmunt Plater , Professor of Law at Boston College Law School , agrees . `` In the short term , it 's in everyone 's interests within the company to low-ball -- but the portents are there for a realistic inflation of $ 20 - $ 50 billon , '' he said . An analysis by Reuters of the potential fines , damages , costs related directly to the leak , compensation and the damage to BP 's business suggests the final spill bill could , over the long term , end up much higher than BP 's latest provision -- perhaps even more than twice as much . Much hinges on whether U.S. courts find the company was `` grossly negligent '' in the run-up to the disaster , but there are other risks . BP declined to comment for this article , beyond stating that it stands by its statements on the likely costs and that its estimates are based on the assumption that it was not grossly negligent . `` UNPRECEDENTED STRING OF BAD NEWS '' BP 's inability to gauge the true scope of the spill in the early days in April is well documented . After the Deepwater Horizon rig sunk , following an explosion which killed 11 workers , the company initially hoped to staunch the flow of oil from the well by activating shut-off valves with subsea robots . In case this did n't work , it started drilling a relief well to permanently plug the well from below . A week after the blast , the company said the well would take three months to complete and cost $ 100 million -- but that would be the most expensive part of the whole response operation . Combining this with the daily expenditure that BP reported at the time suggested a total bill of $ 200 million . BP hinted then that even this calculation was pessimistic . As estimates of the spill flow increased -- it eventually became the worst in U.S. history -- so did the cost . From an initial 1,000 barrels per day to 5,000 bpd , it finally reached 62,000 bpd . In June , BP told analysts the cost of containing and cleaning up the spill would be $ 3-6 billion . By mid-September , the response effort alone , excluding damages claims , had cost BP $ 8 billion . Investment analysts were forgiving of these errors . The disaster seemed to grow worse and worse making accurate estimates difficult . `` It was an unprecedented string of bad news , '' Simon Hawkins , oil analyst at Ambrian said last month . But even after the well was capped , BP appeared no more adept at forecasting costs . Twelve days after it had sealed the top of the well , on July 27 , the company said the likely cost of the spill would be $ 32 billion . On November 2 , it hiked its estimate by another 25 percent , or $ 8 billion . BP 's Chief Financial Officer Byron Grote blamed that increase mainly on a delay in completing the relief well , which meant the company needed to keep its offshore response effort going longer . In a conference call with analysts , he also cited costs related to decontamination of the thousands of ships used in the spill response and undefined administration and legal costs . BP did not give a detailed breakdown , but it is hard to see how the delay in the relief well accounted for most of the increased provision . Assuming an extra 40 days at the average cash-burn for the operation of $ 60 million per day gives an extra spend of only $ 2.6 billion . In addition to this , the well delay and many extra costs were already clear in July and could have been factored in earlier . Nonetheless , analysts have largely accepted the company 's estimates . Perhaps this is on the assumption that after months of bad publicity , the suspension of dividend payments for at least three quarters , a collapse in its share price to less than half its pre-spill level and a change of CEO , BP would take the opportunity to throw every conceivable cost into the mix and pave the way for recovery under a new boss . It 's a common enough practice when corporations change CEO . `` I tend to believe BP . Given how bad it was , they basically decided to kitchen-sink it , '' says Peter Hitchens , oil analyst at Panmure Gordon . WHAT HISTORY CAN TEACH US Such an assumption , though , may not be entirely safe in BP 's case . The company 's record of assessing costs after past disasters is less than stellar . BP 's Thunder Horse platform in the Gulf of Mexico captured front pages around the world in the summer of 2005 when a hurricane left it listing precariously . The company predicted it would take a year and $ 250 million to repair the damaged platform . In the end , it took almost three years to fix ; analysts estimate BP spent more than $ 500 million . That undershoot was nothing compared with what followed the explosion at its Texas City refinery in 2005 . The blast killed 15 workers and ruined the company 's carefully nurtured reputation as the green and caring face of Big Oil . Because it was a single-point disaster , the cost of Texas City should have been easier to quantify than an ongoing catastrophe like the Gulf spill . A gasoline production unit destroyed in the blast would need to be replaced , BP said . The going cost for such machinery was widely agreed to be in the region of $ 100 - $ 200 million . A few pessimists added in ancillary damages , lost profits and legal", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "BP increased its financial provisions for the Gulf of Mexico oil spill by $8 billion last month, and the company's shares rose on better-than-expected underlying profits and upbeat comments from new CEO Bob Dudley.

With U.S. courts considering whether BP was \"grossly negligent\" in the run-up to the disaster, the final bill could end up much higher than the company's latest provision.

The article implies that BP's estimates of the spill's cost may be too low and that the company could face significant financial penalties, including legal fees and damage claims.

President Obama said Friday morning that his administration is doing `` everything necessary '' to respond . Officials have classified the situation as an `` incident of national significance , '' officially defined as an event that requires a coordinated response to minimize damage , save lives and plan for long-term economic recovery . The government 's National Response Team -- composed of 16 federal agencies and departments -- coordinates the federal response . In that vein , Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano , Interior Secretary Ken Salazar , Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Lisa Jackson , Energy and Climate Change Policy Assistant Carol Browner and NOAA Administrator Jane Lubchenco plan to visit the Gulf Coast region Friday to oversee federal efforts . Napolitano and Salazar will appear jointly on several of the Sunday morning news shows , the White House said . The government and BP Oil have deployed 1,178 people to the region to protect the Gulf Coast shoreline and wildlife , according to the White House . Officials have established five staging areas -- in Biloxi , Miss. , Pensacola , Fla. , Venice , La. , Pascagoula , Miss. , and Theodore , Ala. -- to protect sensitive shorelines . Here 's more agency-specific information -- which will update as necessary : The Coast Guard and BP deployed 76 response vessels , including skimmers , tugs , barges and recovery vessels to assist in containment and cleanup efforts . They 've also sent six fixed-wing aircraft , 11 helicopters , 10 remotely operated vehicles and two mobile offshore drilling units . The public-private response is using 174,060 feet of boom to contain the spill with a total 265,460 feet ordered as of Friday morning . Two C-130 Hercules cargo planes specially designed for aerial spraying have been sent to Mississippi and are awaiting orders to start dumping chemicals on the oil spill , a spokesman told the Associated Press . The Navy also has sent equipment for the cleanup . The agency is monitoring air quality in the region to measure the potential impact of the controlled burn of some of the oil . Jackson said the agency will consult and consider low tech or no tech solutions for preserving the Gulf Coasts fragile ecosystem . Napolitano was the official who declared the spill an '' incident of national significance . '' The department deployed SWAT teams from the Minerals Management Service to inspect 30 drilling rigs operating in the deepwater sections of the Gulf of Mexico . Inspections should be completed within the next week , according to an Interior Department spokeswoman . Inspectors will check to see whether the rigs have conducted blow-out preventer tests and inspect related records , the spokeswoman said . The teams will also verify that emergency well control exercises are taking place . Inspectors will then inspect 47 deep-water production platforms in the gulf , a process that will take longer than rig inspections because of the complexities of the structures . Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr. said Friday he is dispatching attorneys from multiple divisions of the Justice Department to New Orleans to meet with the U.S. attorney and response teams and to monitor the oil spill . The team will be led by Ignacia S. Moreno , head of the environment and natural resources division and Tony West , head of the criminal division . The agency is providing on-site support and predicting the oil spill 's trajectory . The Office of Response and Restoration is the agency 's biggest star , conducting overflight surveys to track the oil slick . The National Weather Service is providing weather forecasts to the entire response team and NOAA is consulting the government and BP folks on the potential impact to fish , birds , marine mammals and sea turtles . It 's also using experimental satellite data to survey the marine pollution and will work on determining the full nature and extent of the damage to natural resources and the restoration work needed . Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton tells NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' that any future offshore drilling `` ca n't be done at the risk of having to spend billions of dollars cleaning up these spills . '' Leave your thoughts in the comments section below Are the teabaggers going to do anything to get their beloved corporate leaders to clean up the mess they made ? Or are they going to be big time hypocrites and demand Obama do something about it ? The spill happened April 20 . 11 days later , and it is still worsening ? I thought we were getting a President that could actually respond to disasters , not lolly gag while things get worse . It is a great summary of the Rep. side of the debate about staying with oil dependency and doing more drilling . I am also glad it is about to land on the soil of Rep. states . I also know that they `` industries '' effected by this will want government intervention and government money . Which the Rep. will want for `` their '' people . Just like farm subsidies . Rep. cry about government spending when they do n't come up with the idea . Hope the oil destroys the coast line maybe then people will see the need for Green Energy . I live in Pensacola , FL and have lived all my life . The only reason I stay here is because its the only part of the gulf that has n't been raped . when will you people learn it 's your own fault for not protesting oil drilling in the first place . All you wanted in the early 2000 's was to get cheaper gas prices and now my home and life is the test tube that you people have used to make your pockets deeper . Much better than Bush 's Katrina . There is no cover up in this . We know what we face in this oil spill . Do n't deny a another natural malfunction of equipment . Do n't EVEN make this sound like Obama 's fault . Or any cover up . If it was a cover up , he would n't be in the Rose Garden talking about it . -LRB- shades of Bush taking so long with Katrina -RRB- This administration is all over this oil spill . Or would you rather have off shore drilling with faulty mechanics . Do n't you all have more brains ? And between this disaster and the disaster in Arizona , you best try to put on a happy face , because it is going to get worse . Our entire Gulf Coast will be affected . 35 years of evolution to correct it all . So anyone `` blaming '' - blame the mechanics of BP And realize what this will do . From Elway 's 2 restaurants in Denver , to the Seafood Shop in the Hamptons . Bye bye shrimp and oysters . Not REP or DEM . you people ca n't see that our way of life here is worth more to us than just a political debate about who was right . This is our home . I 'm not going to dump oil on the white house b\\/c of someones ideas . Its every persons problem . The people in the U.S. are to weak to stand together and fight for a common goal . Stop watching T.V. and complaining about what people you elected are doing . Ohhh ya it was Bush 's brother who told the oil companies they could n't drill off Florida 's coast so Bush haters can suck it .

The committee 's witnesses are Steven Newman , head of Transocean , Lamar McKay , president and Chairman of BP America , and Tim Probert , who is the lucky holder of the title of chief health , safety and environmental officer for Halliburton . You can read their prepared testimony here and what we can say so far is that the three companies are adopting what one observer has called `` the Shaggy defense '' - in the words of Senator Robert Menendez , Democrat of New Jersey : `` BP says Transocean , Transocean says Halliburton I can see the liability chase . '' From the written testimony from the three witnesses , you can see why Menendez might think that . Here 's BP 's Lamar McKay -LRB- pdf -RRB- : BP is one of the lease holders and the operator of this exploration well . As operator , BP hired Transocean to conduct the well drilling operations . Transocean owned the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig and its equipment , including the blowout preventer ... Only seven of the 126 onboard the Deepwater Horizon were BP employees ... Blowout preventers are used on every oil and gas well drilled in the world today . They are carefully and deliberately designed with multiple levels of redundancy and are regularly tested . If they do n't pass the test , they are not used . The systems are intended to fail-closed and be fail-safe ; sadly and for reasons we do not yet understand , in this case , they were not . Transocean 's blowout preventer failed to operate . The committee has been off for a recess , to do some actual voting on the financial regulation bill , and now they are up and running ... read on . 12.00 pm : If you are following these hearings on Twitter , then there 's some excellent live tweeting going on from Kate Sheppard @kate_sheppard and my excellent colleague Suzanne Goldenberg @suzyji , at the hearings itself . If you want to make your life more exciting then watch the whole thing live via the web on C-Span here . 12.11 pm : More on the blame game , this time the drill owner Transocean blaming Halliburton and BP for something going wrong in the cement plug that was supposed to seal the well . Here 's Transocean 's Steven Newman : The cementing process is dictated by the operator 's well plan , and the testing of the cement on the Deepwater Horizon was performed by the cement contractor -LRB- Haliburton in this instance -RRB- as specified and directed by BP ... -LRB- T -RRB- he one thing we know with certainty is that on the evening of April 20 , there was a sudden , catastrophic failure of the cement , the casing , or both . Therein lies the root cause of this occurrence ; without a disastrous failure of one of those elements , the explosion could not have occurred . In other words : nothing to do with us , mate . 12.20 pm : The senators are starting to get unhappy about the blame-game sharing going on here . Lisa Murkowski from Alaska , a state that knows all about oil wants to stop the Reservoir Dogs style face-off : I would suggest to all three of you that we are all in this together because this incident will have an impact on the energy policy of our country . If you ca n't convince people that you can operate safely , not only will BP not be out there , but Transocean wo n't be out there to drill the rigs and Halliburton wo n't be out there cementing .

Also , if you like hearing phrases like `` operating procedures '' and `` manipulating the pipe through the BOP '' . Sometimes some words of English break through . Senator Mary Landrieu asks : `` Will BP pay ? '' That is , over and above the $ 75m cap that legislation allows for . BP 's McKay : `` We 've been very clear . We are going to pay all legitimate claims , all legitimate claims . '' Landrieu : `` Define ` legitimate ' for us ? '' Excuse me while I go and short BP shares . 1pm : Senator Ron Wyden is a bit of hero to many Democrats , and you can see why at this hearing . Here he 's grilling BP which he appears to identify as the villain of this piece over their far-from-spotless safety record in recent years . After Wyden lists some unsafe BP events of recent years , he charges : `` There is a pattern of safety problems at BP . Why has BP not been able to change its corporate culture ? '' BP 's McKay responds : `` I 'll acknowledge we 've got issues and we 've got to change some areas of the company ... It gets down to the agenda and the culture of the company . '' Wyden snorts : `` It sure does ! The culture is that this company has had one accident after another . '' Senator Menendez mentions that the room in which the hearing is being held is the same one used for hearings on the sinking of the Titanic : We were told that the Titanic was so technologically advanced that it could n't sink , and we were told that this well was so technologically advanced that it could n't spill . Unfortunately both of these technological marvels ended in tragedy . In that case , BP will soon be blaming an iceberg . 1.05 pm : It should be mentioned that Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama is very interested in mud . There are technical reasons why this is important . Meanwhile , Kate Sheppard has a good round-up of the intra-mural finger-pointing between the three companies on Mother Jones 's website . 1.19 pm : Maria Cantwell , Democratic senator from Washington state , goes back to the question of BP 's paying compensation , listing a series of areas where BP might have to cough up . But would BP compensate state and local governments , for example , for lost tax revenue ? `` Question mark , '' responds McKay , who is taking most of the heat here . -LRB- Have the senators really forgotten about Halliburton 's toxic PR image , hmm ? -RRB- 1.30 pm : So that brings this part of the hearings to a close - the three execs will now shoot over to the Senate Committee on Environment and Public Works , which might be more exciting since it is n't stuffed with pro-oil state senators -LRB- he said glibly -RRB- . As the hearings wound up , some protesters -LRB- there are a few in the audience -RRB- started an imaginative variation on the old Vietnam War chant : Hey hey , Lamar McKay , who many fish did you kill today ? Call me old fashioned but it does n't quite have the power of `` LBJ , how many kids did you kill today ?

It was unfair when Michael Moore did this to George W. Bush . And it s unfair for Hoft to do it to Barack Obama . Of course , the president might have expected this after comparing the oil spill to 9\\/11 . His point -- that the spill will change the way Americans view relevant national policies -- is fair enough . But even in drawing a more apt analogy to the tragedy of 2001 , invoking that loaded pair of numbers practically invites rhetorical excess . What people fail to realize is that the Office of the President is no only in the Oval Office . It is where ever the President is ... Even on the golf course .

Has he been told yet whose ass he 's supposed to kick ? September 11th was like Pearl Harbor , a day that defined the US and history for an entire generation . Perhaps the oil spill is something that will define the next generation 's commitment to protecting the environment the way we are committed to national security . However it seems that we have a propensity as Americans to fall in love with our political candidates when we elect them and then destroy them when they assume office . This seems sad to me . I have had leadership positions and know what the support of those I worked with meant to me .

Have n't had a vacation in years -- certainly no golfing , trips to the theater in New York , and so on . Obama chose to run for President . It would be good if he did the job before taking all the perks . Get rid of this guy and let 's really MoveOn . I understand that he keeps his total score versus multi-mulligan , pencil whipping Clinton . Obama 's score must be in the high triple digits . He must truly enjoy whacking at a ball several hundred times in four or five hours , but please do n't try and convince us that he needs the downtime because scheming to destroy our country is n't that tough for a socialist . `` Obama is not a hard-working man His vacations taken and per sonal time off are astounding '' ... no true . Matter of fact the award for most time taken goes to George W. Bush ... a total of 548 days while in office . That 's almost two years vacation . Obama will never match Dubya 's vacations . He 's a freemason , a member of the Illuminati , and a puppet of the dread OWO-sponsored foreign relations council . What 's worse , you probably remember how the rumor about McCain having a black child sank his presidential chances back in 2000 in S. Carolina , right ? Well , Barack Obama has TWO black children , and research shows that he openly admits that they 're his , but that he is a mongrel himself and not ashamed to admit it . A BOOGIE IN THE WHITE HOUSE !

For an Obama administration spokesman on the BP oil spill , Adm. Thad Allen , the Coast Guard commandant and national incident commander , is admirably straightforward . Working on behalf of the president who ran a campaign based on the mantra , Yes We Can , Allen awkwardly insists that , in this case , no , the government can t . There are very few circumstances where the government does not have the means or national power to influence something this large , Allen said said in an interview with me at the White House on Wednesday . I think that s a source of immense frustration to everybody . Commentators increasingly lambaste the administration for not taking over the cleanup effort . In a politically calculated response , some administration officials have ratcheted up their rhetoric about keeping the federal government s boot on BP s neck ; they have now threatened to push BP out of the way , which just fuels the anger . But what many of the critics , inside and outside the administration , don t offer is much sense of what the federal government could really do better if it pushed BP aside , other than symbolic actions of questionable value , such as insisting that President Obama visit the Gulf of Mexico again and , as James Carville put it Wednesday , take control , whatever that means . How long will it take for BP to clean up the Gulf of Mexico ? `` A large part of the leak is still spewing oil , '' Allen said . -RRB- Under the water and on the surface , Allen says , there simply isn t much that the federal government can add to what BP is already doing , beyond providing some supplemental brain power , advanced imaging technologies and review of BP s proposals to plug the leak . Things the government has already furnished . The private sector owns nearly all the means to deal with this problem and fix the leak and stop the source . Why doesn t the Coast Guard bring in its own submersibles ? There s too much submersible traffic underwater already , he says . A couple of remote operated vehicles even got tangled inserting a tube to collect spewing oil , lengthening the operation . Why hasn t the government quickly approved a plan Louisiana officials favor to build sand berms that might protect sensitive wetlands ? Because it would take months to execute , anyway . Even so , it s undergoing requisite review at the Army Corps of Engineers . Perhaps BP is the one with the technological capabilities on and under the water . But on land , why isn t the federal government in full control of the cleanup ? It essentially is , Allen argues , since Coast Guard officials are the ones making the top-line decisions and coordinating the effort . By law , he says , BP is responsible for cleaning the mess and hires contractors created after the Exxon Valdez spill that specialize in doing just that . But the federal government is responsible for supervising and ensuring the cleanup is effective . So , according to Allen s reckoning , Americans should at least feel free to hold the administration accountable for how well the cleanup proceeds , even if it might be a tad unfair to blame Obama for BP s inability to plug the leak for more than a month . There are some problems that simply can not be fixed quickly , no matter who is in charge . But on shore , Allen points out , BP and the government have fewer restrictions on how they can react once oil is sighted . That implies more responsibility , particularly since the government is , apparently , taking such an active role . That will be little comfort to the angry Louisianans who lined up Tuesday at a town hall meeting in Plaquemines Parish to yell at officials about what they perceive as government inaction . Nor will it help the administration s press operation , which would surely prefer to have BP as an enemy rather than as a partner . But , like it or not , BP is the administration s right hand in this effort , a fact Allen has made clear for days . Indeed , part of the reason the administration 's messaging on the oil spill falls flat is that some officials attempt to play political defense by excoriating the company , even while it must admit that BP is its partner of necessity . In so doing , the Obama administration legitimizes unfocused and perhaps unfair complaints about the organization of its effort to cap and clean up the oil leak , even though , according to Allen , the White House probably couldn t do much of substance to redress many of those very criticisms . The White House is in a hard spot . The president will probably take a hit for this , fair or no , no matter what administration spokespeople say . All the more reason to be straight with Americans , as Allen seems to be , about what the government can and can t reasonably be expected to do . The truth is nobody knows whether or not the administration is not doing all it can . But like in any crisis the lack of knowledge does n't stop anyone from having a strong opinion . The smartest thing this administration has done is to STAY OUT OF THIS with regard to management ! With all due respect to the severity of this situation , even the EXPERTS in oil extraction and exploration are at odds as to what to do . Do you seriously want the government to take the reigns -LRB- and therefore the responsibility -RRB- away from areas those industries that have spend decades becoming familiar with ? We all want this thing to end , but to panic and grab the wheel away from the driver is THE WRONG thing to do . Perhaps the government should make itself available to these industries with regard to equipment and manpower , but certainly NOT direction ! Where 's the White House on that ? Oh , that 's right , a number of states on the Gulf have REPUBLICAN governors . That is too cute on the White House 's part to allow the states to beg for help . -LRB- Bobby Jindal of Louisiana is in such a spot . -RRB- Rather crude and unprofessional for this White House . We are as mad as hell ! Clean this mess up ! Interior Secretary Ken Salazar appeared May 18 , 2010 , for several Senate hearings . Many lawmakers examined the leadership of the Minerals Management Service . The Interior Department is charged with enforcing environmental and safety rules for energy exploration . Ken Salazar was working on the Cape Wind commercial wind turbine permit while the Gulf oil platform was on fire ! Soon after the platform sank into the Gulf Ken traveled to Massachusetts to announce that he had approved the Cape Wind permit ! On April 28.2010 Ken Salazar announced his decision at a joint Massachusetts State House news conference with Gov. Deval Patrick voting to go forward with the Nantucket , Massachusetts wind turbine project . The same day of this decision more than 5000 barrels of oil had poured into the Gulf of Mexico . -LRB- one barrel equals 42 gallons -RRB- . Several days later the MMS was broken into several sections ! Do we trust our government ? In retrospect should congress review the Cape Wind permit given out during the failures of MMS ? Obama , well aware that solving this takes the cooperation of the best deep water operations engineers in the world , is wise enough to listen and stay out of the way . Patton described it best : `` Tell your people what you want done and then leave it to them to do it . They will surprise and delight you with the ingenuity of their solutions . '' We have a problem because the prior planning BP should have had to do to get their drilling permit was n't done because BP declared that the chances of a spill were `` remote '' , and the Bush administration did n't question their asertion , it just let them drill . Now , after the fact and on a totally pragmatic basis BP is doing the disaster planning it should have done to get the drilling permit in the first place .
