Thad Allen , the government 's point man on the crisis . \nAllen said two possible reasons were being debated by scientists : The reservoir that is the source of the oil could be running lower three months into the spill . \nOr there could be an undiscovered leak somewhere down in the well . \nAllen ordered further study but remained confident . \n`` This is generally good news , '' he said . \nBut he cautioned , `` We need to be careful not to do any harm or create a situation that can not be reversed . '' \nInside BP 's command center hundreds of miles away in Houston , engineers , scientists and technicians have been carefully monitoring reams of data around the clock , BP 's chief operating officer , Doug Suttles , told The Associated Press Friday . \nOther engineers watched on monitors aboard ships at sea . \n`` You 've got a very , very focused group of people because this is very important , '' Suttles said . \nAsked if people are nervous , knowing the whole world is watching and government officials are sitting with them to monitor their work , Suttles replied : `` I would n't say they are nervous . \nI would use the word focused . '' \nThroughout the day , no one was declaring victory -- or failure . \nPresident Barack Obama cautioned the public `` not to get too far ahead of ourselves , '' warning of the danger of new leaks `` that could be even more catastrophic . '' \nEven if the cap passes the test , more uncertainties lie ahead : Where will the oil already spilled go ? \nHow long will it take to clean up the coast ? \nWhat will happen to the region 's fishermen ? \nAnd will life on the Gulf Coast ever be the same again ? \nOn Thursday , BP closed the vents on the new , tight-fitting cap and finally stopped crude from spewing into the Gulf of Mexico for the first time since the April 20 oil-rig explosion that killed 11 workers and unleashed the spill 5,000 feet down . \nWith the cap working like a giant cork to keep the oil inside the well , scientists kept watch in case the buildup of pressure underground caused new leaks in the well pipe and in the surrounding bedrock that could make the disaster even worse . \nPressure readings after 24 hours were about 6,700 pounds per square inch and rising slowly , Allen said , below the 7,500 psi that would clearly show the well was not leaking . \nHe said pressure continued to rise between 2 and 10 psi per hour . \nA low pressure reading , or a falling one , could mean the oil is escaping . \nBut Allen said a seismic probe of the surrounding sea floor found no sign of a leak in the ground . \nBenton F. Baugh , president of Radoil Inc. in Houston and a National Academy of Engineering member who specializes in underwater oil operations , warned that the pressure readings could mean that an underground blowout could occur . \nHe said the oil coming up the well may be leaking out underground and entering a geological pocket that might not be able to hold it . \nBut Roger N. Anderson , a professor of marine geology and geophysics at Columbia University , said the oil pressure might be rising slowly not because of a leak , but because of some kind of blockage in the well . \n`` If it 's rising slowly , that means the pipe 's integrity 's still there . \nIt 's just getting around obstacles , '' he said . \nHe added that `` any increase in pressure is good , not bad . '' \nThe cap is designed to prevent oil from spilling into the Gulf , either by keeping it bottled up in the well , or by capturing it and piping it to ships on the surface . \nIt is not yet clear which way the cap will be used if it passes the pressure test . \nEither way , the cap is a temporary measure until a relief well can be completed and mud and cement can be pumped into the broken well deep underground to seal it more securely than the cap . \nThe first of the two relief wells being drilled could be done by late July or August . \nIn a positive sign , work on the relief wells resumed Friday . \nThe project had been suspended earlier this week for fear that the capping of the well could interfere with it . \nThere was no end in sight to the cleanup in the water and on shore . \nSomewhere between 94 million and 184 million gallons have spilled into the Gulf , according to government estimates . \nIn Orange Beach , Ala. , long strands of white absorbent boom strung along the shore were stained chocolate brown after a fresh wave of BB-size tar balls washed up . \nCharter boat captains who ca n't fish because of the spill patrolled the shore , looking for oil slicks . \nFishing guides spent their time ferrying Coast Guard personnel . \nA flotilla of fishing boats operating as skimmers plied the waters across the Gulf . \nLarge sections of the Gulf Coast have been closed to fishing and shellfish harvesting . \nMany fishermen have been hired out by BP to do cleanup work . \nCade Thomas , a 38-year-old fishing guide from Pine , La. , said the whole mentality of the place is different . \n`` It 's all changed dramatically . \nThe fishing stories are n't there , '' he said . \n`` There 's no stories to tell except where we went to today and how much oil we saw . '' \nIn Grand Isle , La. , most of the summer rental cottages are vacant , tables at the single high-end seafood restaurant are empty , and souvenir shops are barely doing enough business to pay the bills . \nA hand-painted sign along the main road rechristens the tourist town `` Grand Oil . '' \nFolks are grateful the gusher has been stopped , but many say it is too late to save this summer . \nThousands of tourists have gone elsewhere . \nScientists can not say for certain what the long-term environmental effect will be . \nBut long after the well is finally plugged , oil could still be washing up in marshes and on beaches as tar balls or patties . \nThere is also fear that months from now , those tar balls could move west to Corpus Christi , Texas , or travel up and around Florida to Miami or North Carolina 's Outer Banks . \nCapping the well was a milestone in the long catastrophe , but people should n't let their guards down , said Billy Nungesser , the president of Plaquemines Parish , one of the hardest hit areas along the Gulf . \nWeber reported from Houston . \nAssociated Press Writers Holbrook Mohr , Vicki Smith , Shelia Byrd , Jay Reeves , Matt Sedensky , Kevin McGill , and Ramit Plushnick-Masti contributed to this report .

' \nDated 7 March and bearing the name of Blackwater 's president , Gary Jackson , the electronic newsletter adds that terrorists ` need to get creamed , and it 's fun , meaning satisfying , to do the shooting of such folk . ' \nHuman rights groups said yesterday that the comments raised fresh questions over the role of civilian contractors operating in Iraq and other world flashpoints . \n` We are very concerned about the increased use of security companies , there needs to be more inspection and regulation of these companies , ' said a spokesman for Amnesty International . \nBlackwater has already been the subject of lobbying efforts to introduce tighter regulations on private military operations in Iraq . \nIt is one of the fastest growing private security firms in the world , and achieved global prominence last year when four of its men were ambushed by a crowd of Iraqis and their bodies mutilated and dragged around the Iraqi city of Falluja . \nThe controversial wording of the Blackwater bulletin appears to be an attempt to criticise the ` righteous outcry ' that followed a recent statement from a senior US Marine general who , on returning home from Iraq , claimed it was ` fun to shoot some people ' . \nWhile the views of Lieutenant-General James Mattis drew a frosty response from the Pentagon , others said his observations reflected the harsh realities of war . \nBlackwater 's entry to the debate appears to suggest that satisfaction can be drawn from combat if ` the bad guys ' get what they deserve . \n` All of us who have ever waited through an hour and a half movie , or read some 300 pages of a thriller , to the point when the bad guys finally get their comeuppance know this perfectly well , ' says the opening address of the six-page bulletin , which The Observer believes to be authentic . \nCalled Blackwater Tactical Weekly , the newsletter was sent to environmental activist Frank Hewetson as well as the firm 's staff . \nLast year Hewetson was offered a job by Blackwater with a salary of up to # 85,000 plus health benefits to work with its ` military crisis operations support team .

' \nAmong its various roles in post-war Iraq , Blackwater has guarded provincial outposts for the Iraqi coalition provisional authority and had the contract to keep former chief US envoy Paul Bremer alive . \nThe company has been praised for its role in the rescue of a wounded soldier in Najaf . \nDefense experts have described Blackwater as a major player in the field of private arms with an important role to play in aiding American security in the war on terror . \nOther Blackwater emails seen by The Observer , from last year , indicate the large market for civilian contractors in war zones . \n` We will probably require at least 3000-4000 professionals above and beyond what we have in the Blackwater employment and resource system , ' states one . \nThere are thought to be as many as 20,000 private enterprise soldiers in Iraq , with the US military an advocate of their use . \nThis system allows governments to save money on paying permanent soldiers , and offers the political bonus that it is unlikely to attract as much media attention as conventional troops . \nThe Observer made numerous attempts to contact Blackwater 's head office in North Carolina , but no calls were returned . \nThere is , however , no evidence that company staff have ever shot people for fun . \nThe firm is understood to have disciplined and well-trained recruits . \nA number are thought to be elite soldiers who have retired from military special-operations units . \nBlackwater also offers extensive psychological counselling programs to combat potentially traumatic battlefield stress .

'' \nBut fishermen at the meeting complained they felt excluded so far from BP 's jobs program and could not read BP contracts or follow the training course it has provided because they do not speak English . \n`` I just want a chance to go to work and make money , '' said Thoai Tong , a deckhand who has been acting as a translator for Vietnamese fishermen . \nIf the waters do not reopen for fishing , the community will in the long term be forced to move from the area to find fishing elsewhere , he said . \nKinnaird said the fishermen 's concerns would be addressed , and future training sessions and contracts would be translated . \nIn Alabama and Louisiana fishermen reported another problem with the cleanup contracts : outsiders rather than locals were being given jobs . \nBP contractors have passed over local fishermen to hire out-of-state boat crews to lay booms off the coast of Bayou La Batre , Alabama , the heart of that state 's seafood industry , according to local officials . \nHundreds of local fishermen in both states went through more than four hours of hazardous-materials training this week to prepare for temporary work with BP , only to be left waiting for a call that never came , they said . \nInstead , 81 vessels plying Alabama coastal waters under contract with BP for oil-spill containment work all had crews from elsewhere , some from as far away as Maine , said Bayou La Batre Mayor Stan Wright . \n`` Not one is from the state of Alabama , '' Wright said . \n`` I 'm very upset about that . \nThat 's no different than a man coming home for dinner and finding his wife in bed with someone else .

'' \nOf 13 employee evaluations reviewed by investigators , 12 had documented ways they had saved the company large sums of money , typically six-figure amounts , and one had put together a spreadsheet showing that he could account for $ 490,000 in savings , said Jason Mathews , an investigator for the Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement , which is conducting the joint inquiry with the Coast Guard . \nBP witnesses have acknowledged this week and in previous hearings that oil drilling is a business , and costs have to be taken into account . \nBut they 've said safety always comes first , and they denied compromising safety to save money . \nThe government this week raised the question of whether BP took incremental shortcuts because it felt rushed to finish the problem-plagued Macondo exploration well , a job costing BP about a million dollars a day . \nSimply leasing the Deepwater Horizon rig from Transocean was costing $ 525,000 a day . \nEleven people died when the mile-deep well blew out April 20 , and more than 4 million gallons of oil spewed into the Gulf of Mexico in the nation 's worst offshore oil spill . \nOne document introduced into evidence this week showed that the Macondo job , originally projected as a $ 96 million operation , was on track to cost $ 58 million more than anticipated . \nBP kept track of estimated completion dates for drilling jobs , and tried to figure out where the rig could go next so that it could stay active and have minimal down time . \nE-mails discussed by attorneys this week showed that BP hoped to squeeze in a quick job in May - plugging a well called Nile - before tackling a more complex job at another site , the Kaskida well , that might take six months . \nMathews asked John Guide , the BP well team leader for the Macondo job , whether cost-consciousness colored decisions involving safety . \n`` No sir , '' Guide answered . \nHe added : `` It is a business , so yes , there is consideration for monetary things . \nBut like I said before , even though you could phrase it that way , safety was always the Number 1 priority . \nSafety was never compromised in the operation . '' \nAlso testifying this week for the first time was a key BP engineer , Gregory Walz , the engineering team leader for the Macondo well . \nWalz participated in some of the most critical decisions regarding the cement job , which BP 's own internal investigation has cited as a major factor in the blowout . \nNotes from BP 's internal interview with Walz on July 29 were discussed at the hearing Thursday . \nWalz told the BP investigators that they were concerned about using only six centralizers to position the casing prior to the cement job , but thought they could mitigate any potential `` channeling '' by repositioning the centralizers and using a less-dense , nitrogen-foamed cement recipe . \nWalz had a `` brief discussion '' with Guide about a Halliburton model showing that there could be a `` severe '' gas flow problem in the well if only six centralizers were used , but `` they had a foamed cement slurry which was designed to protect against gas migration , '' the BP internal notes say . \nWalz thought that 15 additional centralizers that he 'd ordered flown to the rig had turned out to be the wrong type and would create potential mechanical problems in the completion of the well . \nAccording to the BP notes , Guide and Walz `` did not discuss stopping and ordering the correct style of centralizer . '' \nBP 's internal inquiry , released in September , said the 15 additional centralizers were the correct style after all . \nAs a backup - a contingency if they had signs of a bad cement job - the BP well team decided it could run a test called a cement bond log . \nWalz testified that the well team followed an established `` decision tree '' when it came time to decide whether to run that test . \nWhen the first analysis of the cement job looked positive , including no signs of mud being lost in the well , Guide said in a conference call that he saw no reason to run the test , and Walz and other participants in the call concurred , according to Walz in his BP interview . \nBP would have had to pay a contractor , Schlumberger , about $ 128,000 to run the test that would have taken 12 to 18 hours if there had been no problems , Guide testified . \nBut BP decided to forgo the test and the Schlumberger workers left the rig on a helicopter the morning of April 20 . \n`` Based on the information I had at the time , I felt we acted properly , '' Walz testified . \nEleven hours after the Schlumberger workers left the rig , the well erupted .

'' \nUp on the rig , the first thing workers noticed was the sea water in the drill column suddenly shooting back at them , rocketing 240 feet in the air , he said . \nThen , gas surfaced . \n`` What we had learned when I worked as a drill rig laborer was swoosh , boom , run , '' Bea said . \n`` The swoosh is the gas , boom is the explosion and run is what you better be doing . '' \nThe gas flooded into an adjoining room with exposed ignition sources , he said . \n`` That 's where the first explosion happened , '' said Bea , who worked for Shell Oil in the 1960s during the last big northern Gulf of Mexico oil well blowout . \n`` The mud room was next to the quarters where the party was . \nThen there was a series of explosions that subsequently ignited the oil that was coming from below . '' \nAccording to one interview transcript , a gas cloud covered the rig , causing giant engines on the drill floor to run too fast and explode . \nThe engines blew off the rig and set `` everything on fire , '' the account said . \nAnother explosion below blew more equipment overboard . \nBP spokesman John Curry would not comment Friday night on whether methane gas or the series of events described in the internal documents caused the accident . \n`` Clearly , what happened on the Deepwater Horizon was a tragic accident , '' said Curry , who is based at an oil spill command center in Robert , Louisiana . \n`` We anticipate all the facts will come out in a full investigation . '' \nThe BP executives were injured but survived , according to one account . \nNine rig crew on the rig floor and two engineers died . \n`` The furniture and walls trapped some and broke some bones but they managed to get in the life boats with assistance from others , '' said the transcript . \nThe reports made Bea , the 73-year-old industry veteran , cry . \n`` It sure as hell is painful , '' he said . \n`` Tears of frustration and anger . '' \nA 100-ton concrete-and-steel vault has been lowered onto the ruptured well , an important step in a delicate and unprecedented attempt to stop most of the gushing crude fouling the sea . \n`` We are essentially taking a four-story building and lowering it 5,000 feet and setting it on the head of a pin , '' BP spokesman Bill Salvin told The Associated Press . \nUnderwater robots guided the 40-foot-tall box into place in a slow-moving drama . \nNow that the contraption is on the seafloor , workers will need at least 12 hours to let it settle and make sure it 's stable before the robots can hook up a pipe and hose that will funnel the oil up to a tanker . \nOn Saturday , the boat with the plumbing equipment for the containment box was about 1.5 miles from the vessel that lowered the box . \nIt 's unclear exactly when the pipework will begin . \n`` It appears to be going exactly as we hoped , '' Salvin said on Friday afternoon , shortly after the four-story device hit the seafloor . \n`` Still lots of challenges ahead , but this is very good progress . '' \nIt could be Sunday or Monday before officials learn whether the box the size of a house can capture up to 85 percent of the oil . \nThe task became increasingly urgent as toxic oil crept deeper into the bays and marshes of the Mississippi Delta . \nA sheen of oil began arriving on land last week , and crews have been laying booms , spraying chemical dispersants and setting fire to the slick to try to keep it from coming ashore . \nBut now the thicker , stickier goo -- arrayed in vivid , brick-colored ribbons -- is drawing ever closer to Louisiana 's coastal communities . \nThe Coast Guard and BP said Saturday about 2.1 million gallons of an oil-water mix had been collected , with about 10 percent being oil and the rest water . \nMore than 160 miles of boom to contain the oil has been put out and crews have used nearly 275,000 gallons of chemicals to break up the oil on the water 's surface . \nThere are still untold risks and unknowns with the containment box : The approach has never been tried at such depths , where the water pressure is enough to crush a submarine , and any wrong move could damage the leaking pipe and make the problem worse . \nThe seafloor is pitch black and the water murky , though lights on the robots illuminate the area where they are working . \nIf the box works , another one will be dropped onto a second , smaller leak at the bottom of the Gulf . \nAt the same time , crews are drilling sideways into the well in hopes of plugging it up with mud and concrete , and they are working on other ways to cap it . \nInvestigators looking into the cause of the explosion have been focusing on the so-called blowout preventer . \nFederal regulators told The Associated Press Friday that they are going to examine whether these last-resort cutoff valves on offshore oil wells are reliable . \nBlowouts are infrequent , because well holes are blocked by piping and pumped-in materials like synthetic mud , cement and even sea water . \nThe pipes are plugged with cement , so fluid and gas ca n't typically push up inside the pipes . \nInstead , a typical blowout surges up a channel around the piping . \nThe narrow space between the well walls and the piping is usually filled with cement , so there is no pathway for a blowout . \nBut if the cement or broken piping leaves enough space , a surge can rise to the surface . \nThere , at the wellhead of exploratory wells , sits the massive steel contraption known as a blowout preventer . \nIt can snuff a blowout by squeezing rubber seals tightly around the pipes with up to 1 million pounds of force . \nIf the seals fail , the blowout preventer deploys a last line of defense : a set of rams that can slice right through the pipes and cap the blowout . \nDeepwater Horizon was also equipped with an automated backup system called a Deadman . \nIt should have activated the blowout preventer even if workers could not . \nBased on the interviews with rig workers , none of those safeguards worked .

'' ET Monday on CNN . \nTripoli , Libya -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi took aim at the rebel-controlled town of Ras Lanuf Monday , launching aerial strikes as part of an assault aimed at crushing the uprising against him . \nAt the end of the third week of unrest -- protests began February 15 -- Gadhafi 's aerial forces targeted the main road heading into the oil town after launching another air strike earlier , five kilometers southeast of the city . \nIn what has turned into a civil war , members of the opposition fired anti-aircraft guns toward Gadhafi 's planes . \nSome families fled Ras Lanuf , hoping to escape the violence that has engulfed some of the country 's most populous areas . \nInside the mind of Saif Gadhafi British diplomatic team taken in Libya Libya conflict moves closer to capital Meanwhile , U.K. Foreign Secretary William Hague said `` there are credible reports of the use of helicopter gunships against civilians by government forces .

Security Council -- France , Britain , and the United States -- were working Monday on a possible resolution that would include language on a no-fly zone over Libya , diplomatic sources at the United Nations said . \nBut any kind of military intervention could face sharp criticism from Russia and China , two permanent members of the council that wield veto power . \nU.S. President Barack Obama said Monday he had a `` very clear message to those who are around Col. Gadhafi : It is their choice to make how they operate moving forward and they will be held accountable for whatever violence continues to take place there . '' \n`` We 've got NATO as we speak consulting in Brussels around a wide range of potential options , including potential military options , in response to the violence that continues to take place inside Libya , '' he said . \nIn a statement , NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said NATO did not intend to intervene in Libya , but `` as a defense Alliance and a security organization , it is our job to conduct prudent planning for any eventuality .

Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon appointed a new special envoy to Libya to discuss the crisis with officials in Tripoli , the United Nations said in a statement Monday . \n`` The secretary-general is deeply concerned about the fighting in western Libya , which is claiming large numbers of lives and threatens even more carnage in the days ahead , '' read the U.N. statement . \n`` He notes that civilians are bearing the brunt of the violence , and calls for an immediate halt to the government 's disproportionate use of force and indiscriminate attacks on civilian targets . '' \nDeath toll estimates have ranged from more than 1,000 to as many as 2,000 , and the international community has been pondering strategies on how to end the violence and remove the Gadhafi regime . \nThe fierce fighting has also sparked the flight of Libyans and foreigners out of Libya , with nations across the globe scrambling to help people leave . \nAbout 200,000 people have fled Libya with nearly equal numbers going to Tunisia and Egypt , the U.N. refugee agency has said . \nBut not everyone has been able to get out . \nBetween 15,000 and 17,000 people are still at a refugee camp near the Libya-Tunisia border . \nOf those left , the majority are from Bangladesh , the U.N. refugee agency said . \nThe group plans to start running chartered flights to there Tuesday . \nPresident Obama authorized Monday sending up to $ 15 million in humanitarian aid to Libya out of the United States Emergency Refugee and Migration Assistance Fund . \nHumanitarian and medical aid to Misrata , in central Libya , has been blocked , U.N. emergency relief coordinator Valerie Amos said in a statement Sunday . \nShe urged authorities `` to provide access without delay to allow aid workers to help save lives .

'' \n`` I 'm not going to open a Twitter account because it 's too dangerous . '' \nAnother activist , who asked to be referred to as Ammar , said he used to post anti-government comments on his Facebook page but stopped after his uncle , who is a member of the ruling Baath Party and works closely with local security , warned him that his name had come up as a dissident . \n`` My uncle told me that I 'm now on a list of people who the -LRB- Syrian -RRB- security are keeping an eye on . \n-LRB- My uncle said -RRB- it must be because security were scanning my Facebook activity , '' he said at a cafe in the Old City of Damascus . \nIn May , U.S. officials told the Washington Post that Iran had started providing the Syrian government with sophisticated surveillance equipment to assist in tracking down opponents via the Internet . \nOfficials said the same techniques were used in Iran to crush a pro-democracy `` Green Movement '' in 2009 . \nBoth Iran and Syria deny that Tehran is sending equipment to help the Syrian government spy on its own citizens . \nSince taking power in 2000 , President Bashar al-Assad 's government has sought to stifle dissent by banning websites like Facebook , where users can interact with other members outside Syria . \nMany Internet cafes in Damascus started using web proxies to bypass the block and gain access to Facebook , but earlier this year Syrians suddenly found they could get onto the site . \nActivists say it was a ploy . \n`` The government reopened Facebook because they realized that it was more useful for them to allow activists to communicate on the site , and then track us down using their team of loyalists who search the Internet , '' Rana said . \nBut pro-Assad Syrians have come out in the thousands to voice their support for the president online , another possible reason for unblocking social media websites . \nAn online battle has ensued in which pro- and anti-government users have created Facebook groups to support or condemn the government . \n`` It is important to show my love for my president on Facebook , because many people outside Syria think that there is a revolution in Syria against Assad , but that 's not true , '' Muhammad Merei , a student from the coastal town of Lattakia , told Reuters in a Facebook message . \n`` They wanted to -LRB- create -RRB- a civil war , they attacked the army and killed many people , '' he added . \nMerei , who has a picture of Assad on his Facebook page , is a member of dozens of pro-Assad Facebook groups , including one dedicated to closing the prominent dissident group , `` Syrian Revolution 2011 .

'' \nThe attack that began Thursday , he speculated , was intended to regain control of Rayayna , population 12,000 . \nResidents east of the town had `` declared their support for the rebels a month ago , '' he said , while the rest of the town remains loyal to Gadhafi and his former head of internal security , Nasar al Mabout . \nHajj Usama said al Mabout lives there . \nSince the raids began , Hajj Usama said , he has lost contact with rebels in Rayayna with the exception of one commander who managed to make the dangerous journey to Zintan after his house was destroyed in the shelling . \nAs dusk fell Friday the shelling visible earlier from the roofs of Zintan abated . \nBut shortly before 10 p.m. , the attack resumed with sporadic barrages of gunfire . \nThe rebels said the night shelling may have been intended to terrorize Zintan 's residents so they would flee . \nSome have , but most were staying to brave out the battle they fear is far from over , Hajj Usama said . \nEarly Friday , NATO jets pounded Libyan ports , destroying eight of Gadhafi 's warships , an alliance spokesman said . \nNATO targeted the ships in Tripoli , Al-Khums and Sirte after it was apparent that Gadhafi 's forces were increasingly using naval vessels to launch attacks on civilians , said Mike Bracken , NATO 's military spokesman . \nGadhafi was indiscriminately mining waters in Misrata and hampering the flow of humanitarian aid , Bracken said . \n`` He was using maritime forces to lay mines . \nThese were legal targets , '' Bracken said at a briefing in Brussels , Belgium . \nHe did not say whether crew members were aboard when the ships were hit . \nThe NATO campaign is progressing and Gadhafi 's combat power had been severely curtailed , Bracken said . \nBut the Libyan leader 's forces continued their heavy shelling of Dehiba , on the Tunisian border , where thousands of refugees have amassed in recent weeks . \nThe border crossing , through which humanitarian aid is often trucked in , was closed Friday . \nAlong the southern borders , rebels had gained control of border crossings between Libya and Sudan and Libya and Chad and had regained control of Kufra in the southeast , according to a report by the International Medical Corps , which has teams in Libya and Tunisia . \nThe global medical organization said rebel control along the Chad border was significant because supplies flow through there to Gadhafi 's forces . \n`` While control of the entire border will be difficult , the rebels are reported to have a large force in the region , '' it said . \n`` The Niger and Morocco border crossings remain under Gadhafi control .

Bybee implied that `` torture is a legitimate form of interrogation , '' and that it should be used in accordance with the Geneva Conventions . \nThe solitary governmental voice apparently raised against it was that of Colin Powell , who is no longer secretary of state . \nEurope is not entirely divorced from this process . \nWhen Ireland took the United Kingdom to the European Court of Human Rights over the treatment of suspects in Northern Ireland in 1978 , the Strasbourg court held that such practices as hooding , sensory disorientation and sleep disruption in pursuit of information amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment - which are also banned by the human rights convention - but not to torture . \nBybee and his colleagues built on this in seeking to limit the meaning of torture , for the purposes of the international Convention Against Torture , to little more than mutilation and murder . \nBut they also , and inconsistently , developed a theory that in fighting terrorism the president , as commander-in-chief , is in any case not bound by either national or international law . \nGonzales , for his part , brought into being the hitherto unknown category of `` unlawful combatant '' , to whom the protections of the Geneva Conventions could be denied because , although a soldier , such a combatant was fighting for a faction -LRB- the Taliban or al-Qaida -RRB- and not a state . \nThe word `` unlawful '' in this context has no meaning except to signify that such people will be denied the protection of the law . \nThe licence it carries has been silently transferred to Iraq , which on any view is a state . \nPowell 's objections to the destruction of the work of a century of international law were brushed aside by Gonzales . \nThe documents which have now revealed all this , and very much more , are collected in each of these solid volumes . \nThey cover largely the same ground - an assembly of official memoranda and reports , most of them never intended for publication , prefaced by brief editorial essays . \nAlthough Mark Danner 's book is short of an index , there is little need for more : comment on most of the documents would look feeble beside the documents themselves . \nThe official military reports on the revealed abuses have been published by the US administration . \nThe rest -LRB- including , one assumes , the report of the International Red Cross , which ordinarily speaks only to governments -RRB- have been leaked ; though in some cases - notably that of the legal memoranda - partial leakage prompted full disclosure . \nNothing much seems to have been obtained under the Freedom of Information Act . \nFor Iraqis , already accustomed to unspeakable things happening to anyone detained by Saddam 's police in Abu Ghraib , little can have changed . \nBut one of America 's leading legal journalists , Anthony Lewis of the New York Times , in an illuminating introduction to The Torture Papers , draws out the grim moral that - in the words of the former national security adviser to George Bush senior , Donald Gregg - it was the legal memoranda that `` cleared the way for the horrors that have been revealed '' in the US-run detention facilities . \nThese books contain extensive evidence that Lewis and Gregg are right . \nThey include a mass of depositions and reports about what was going on in the detention facilities . \nReading the detailed and objective findings of investigating officers , one begins to wonder whether the brutality was not in truth the rogue activity of a few privates , corporals and paramilitaries , while the legal sanctioning of torture thousands of miles away in Washington had more to do with the sophisticated techniques taught over many decades by the US Special Forces and CIA to client dictatorships . \nBut it becomes inexorably apparent that the crude use of fear and pain on detainees was not simply the localized abuse of absolute power by individuals unfit to hold it . \nStripping Iraqi men of their clothing and making them wear women 's underwear for days on end , or setting dogs on them when naked , makes a precise fit with the official doctrine that anything short of killing and maiming is a legitimate way of breaking people down for interrogation . \nEvidence has crept out of Afghanistan of the use of similar techniques there . \nDanner , in one of his own New York Review of Books articles which introduce his volume , traces `` water-boarding '' -LRB- repeated near-drowning -RRB- from the French war in Algeria through the dirty war in Argentina to the interrogation since 9\\/11 by CIA operatives of `` high value '' suspects in locations which have never been disclosed . \nDoes even a democracy have nevertheless to countenance such methods when its back is to the wall ? \nOther democracies have not thought so : many of their governments have refused to pass illiberal laws in response to terrorism , and where some have sought to do so their judiciaries have pointed out that if the reaction to terrorists is to abandon the rule of law , terrorism will have achieved an irreversible victory . \nThe supreme court of India in 2003 held that India 's prevention of terrorism laws must respect the fundamental human rights recognized in the constitution . \nThe Israeli supreme court , under its remarkable president Aharon Barak , has - not too successfully , it must be said - told the government and army in a series of judgments that while democracy is fated to fight with one hand tied behind its back , `` none the less , it has the upper hand . \nPreserving the rule of law and recognition of individual liberties ... strengthen its spirit , and this strength allows it to overcome its difficulties '' . \nIn this country the law lords , rejecting the legacy of wartime decisions permitting arbitrary executive detention , have found detention without trial a greater evil than the evil it is intended to challenge . \nPerhaps the strongest evidence that the abuse of prisoners in US hands has been systemic , not aberrant , is the simplest : it is the fact that those involved felt it was quite safe to be photographed repeatedly while committing it . \nPersonnel who fear disciplinary reprisal , or even disapproval , do not usually make a visual record of their conduct . \nIf it says something for Donald Rumsfeld , the defense secretary , that he twice tendered his resignation over the Abu Ghraib disclosures , it says rather more about the Bush administration that his offer was on both occasions rejected . \nThe outcome of the events tracked in these two books , for which both men bear responsibility , is a world order of which the icon has become a hooded figure , its arms outstretched in torment . \nThe apologists who blame a few bad apples in the barrel might do well to remember what a few bad apples do : they make the whole barrel rotten . \nStephen Sedley is a judge of the court of appeal for England and Wales Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Review : The Torture Papers and Torture and Truth This article appeared on p14 of the Guardian review section of the Guardian on 01.27 GMT on Saturday 5 March 2005 Latest news and views from the Guardian 's books team paullaity : Read this : clever and funny and rightly cutting .

'' \n`` Our resolute Libyan people , the Libyan land is your own , '' said the 69-year-old who ran the country since he was 27 until two weeks ago . \n`` Those who try to take it from you now , they are intruders , they are mercenaries , they are stray dogs . '' \nThe NTC said on Thursday it had taken control of Bani Walid , one of Gaddafi 's last bastions in the east of the country . \nSome of its commanders suspect Gaddafi himself might be hiding inside . \nTwo of the defenders were killed and one of the siege force wounded in overnight skirmishing , though a military spokesman for the National Transitional Council said the new rulers would abide by a truce until Saturday to allow negotiated surrenders at Bani Walid and Gaddafi 's home town of Sirte , on the coast . \n`` We can do it within two hours maximum , '' Ahmed Bani said of taking over Bani Walid . \nHe said he believed Gaddafi 's son and heir-apparent Saif al-Islam was there , though he did not share the belief of some others in the NTC that his father was . \nReferring to the arrivals this week of senior Gaddafi aides in Niger , across the Sahara desert , which prompted speculation that could be an escape route , Bani said : `` He 's a fox . \nMaybe he wants us to believe that he 's out -LRB- of Libya -RRB- but he 's inside ... close to the border so that in an emergency he can escape . '' \nIn remarks which clearly indicated he was speaking after the reports from Niger were published , Gaddafi said : `` This is not the first time that convoys drive in and out of Niger . '' \nDespite the sweeping and sudden nature of their victory in Tripoli two weeks ago after six months of civil war , the new leadership is still struggling to impose its authority across the capital and the rest of the sprawling , oil-rich desert nation which is home to just six million people . \nThe stalemates around Sirte , Bani Walid and south into the desert town of Sabha -- all pro-Gaddafi bastions -- means the original rebel stronghold of Benghazi is still largely cut off from Tripoli , an 800-km -LRB- 500-mile -RRB- drive away to the west . \nNTC leaders have said they hope to be pumping oil again next week , and the new head of the central bank briefed the media on Thursday to assure Libyans and their foreign business partners that the bank had not been looted by fleeing members of the old regime . \nBusiness as usual was the watchword . \nIn another nod to getting down to government , the interim prime minister Mahmoud Jibril was making his first appearance in Tripoli on Thursday since the uprising . \nBut there is still considerable doubt , contradiction and hesitation about moving the operations of the NTC from Benghazi to the capital . \nSome of that delay appears to stem from long-standing regional rivalries and from a sense that Tripoli may not be a safe place for every Libyan official , as potentially rival militias coalesce around the rebel brigades which swept in to the city from different towns and provinces , eager for a share of power that for 42 years was in the hands of one man only . \nNATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen assured Libyans the Western military alliance whose air power helped topple Gaddafi will keep up the pressure . \n`` NATO and our partners will continue the mission as long as the threat remains , but not a minute longer , '' Rasmussen said . \n`` Gaddafi and the remains of his machine must realize that there is nothing to be gained from more fighting . '' \nNevertheless , Western officials are keen to play down the extent to which they will -- or can -- help track Gaddafi down . \nThe U.S. ambassador to NATO , Ivo Daalder , said Gaddafi 's capture might not signal the end of the campaign : `` It is n't clear that if he were to be taken out that the whole thing would necessarily collapse ; we just do n't know that . \n`` We do know that if he does n't have the capability to pose a threat to civilians , then it does n't really matter . '' \nA diplomat , who spoke on condition of anonymity , repeated alliance statements that NATO was not searching for Gaddafi and suggested its ground surveillance did not cover the south of Libya , which borders countries to which Gaddafi might flee . \n`` The operations plan that we adopted limited the area of operations to the coastal area , '' he said . \n`` It is very expensive and difficult to monitor the entire country , which is mostly desert and very big , '' he said . \n`` Since this was fundamentally about protecting people , rather than watching sands , this was where the resources were located .

' . \nThe London Stock Exchange and Wall Street were closed for holidays on Monday , but BP shares traded in Frankfurt sank 7 percent to close at around 5.40 euros -LRB- $ 6.62 -RRB- on the news of the company 's weekend failure to halt the oil leak . \nBP 's stock has lost nearly a quarter of its value since the oil spill started six weeks ago , wiping nearly 29 billion pounds -LRB- $ 42 billion -RRB- off BP 's market value , according to Reuters data . \nThe disaster , in its 42nd day on Monday , is already the largest oil spill in U.S. history and officials are treating it it as the country 's biggest environmental catastrophe . \nAlthough Louisiana 's wetlands and fishing grounds have been the worst hit so far by the spill , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration said moderate southerly and southwesterly winds this week may start moving oil closer to the Mississippi Delta . \n`` Model results indicate that oil may move north to threaten the barrier islands off Mississippi and Alabama later in the forecast period , '' NOAA said in its 72-hour prediction on the expected trajectory of the huge oil slick . \nMississippi and Alabama have escaped lightly so far , with only scattered tar balls and `` oil debris '' reaching its coasts . \nBut the NOAA forecast was a sober reminder that oil from the unchecked spill , broken up and carried by winds and ocean currents , could threaten a vast area of the U.S. Gulf Coast , including tourism mecca Florida , as well as Cuba and Mexico . \nFollowing the failure this weekend of BP 's attempt to plug the leaking mile -LRB- 1.6 km -RRB- - deep well , public anger over the spill and how it occurred is growing , as tens of thousands of Gulf Coast residents face a pollution impact on their livelihoods . \nA group calling itself Seize BP , which has already staged anti-BP protests , said on Monday it would organize demonstrations in more than 50 U.S. cities from Thursday to Saturday to protest the damage from the leaking oil . \nThe group demands that BP 's assets be immediately seized and held in trust to pay compensation for the spill triggered by the April 20 explosion of the Deepwater Horizon rig . \n`` The greatest environmental disaster with no end in sight ! \nMillions of gallons of oil gushing for months -LRB- and possibly years -RRB- to come . \nA pristine environment destroyed for generations . \nA mega-corporation that has lied and continues to lie , and a government that refuses to protect the people , '' Seize BP said in a statement . \nThe public anger and frustration over the spill poses a major domestic challenge for President Barack Obama , who has been forced to admit publicly that the U.S. government and military do not have the technology to plug the leaking well and must leave this to BP and its private industry partners . \nObama , who made his second visit to the Gulf disaster zone on Friday , is sending three of his top energy and environmental officials back there this week . \nHe is trying to fend off criticism that his administration acted too slowly in its response to the spill , the worst in U.S. history . \nThe crisis could swell into a political liability for the Democratic president as his administration and party , bloodied by bruising healthcare and economic policy debates , head towards key mid-term Congressional elections in November . \nLouisiana 's commercial and recreational fishing industry has already been dealt a hammer blow by the spill . \nFishing boats bobbed idle on Monday at the Venice Marina in Louisiana , which would normally be a hive of activity during the long Memorial Day weekend . \n`` Just take a look around , it 's quiet ... normally it would be ` balls to the walls ' here , '' said marina owner Bill Butler , as he sat wistfully looking at the idle boats . \nAs a health precaution , U.S. authorities have closed all fishing in 25 percent of Gulf of Mexico U.S. federal waters . \nThe Gulf Coast is one of America 's richest ecosystems and a vital breeding ground for a $ 6.5 billion seafood industry . \nULTIMATE HOPES IN RELIEF WELL BP executives say that although the company will try several immediate options to try to control the leak , including the planned deployment of a containment cap in the next few days , the ultimate solution may only lie in the drilling of a relief well that is expected to be completed in August . \nThe drilling of two relief wells that began in May is an expensive but more reliable way to intercept and cap the leaking well . \nThe Gulf spill has surpassed the Exxon Valdez disaster off Alaska in 1989 as the worst U.S. oil spill , with an estimated 12,000 to 19,000 barrels -LRB- 504,000 to 798,000 gallons\\/1 .9 million to 3 million liters -RRB- leaking per day . \nBP is now preparing a containment cap to place on top of a lower marine riser package -LRB- LMRP -RRB- , a piece of equipment that sits atop the failed well blowout preventer on the seabed . \nThe White House said the company would begin cutting a pipe that rises out of the so-called LMRP on Monday or Tuesday . \nIf the containment operation works -- and BP expects to know later this week -- then at least some of the leaking oil could be piped to the surface . \nBut even President Obama 's administration seems to be looking toward August and the relief well solution . \n`` There could be oil coming up until August , '' top White House energy adviser Carol Browner told CBS 's `` Face The Nation '' on Sunday . \n`` We are prepared for the worst .

Klotzbach and William M. Gray describe them as `` running at near-record warm levels . '' \nFor a hurricane to be created , some pre-existing disturbance near Africa , a low-pressure system for example , forms the spark from which the hurricane will ignite . \nThat tropical weakness moves out into the balmy waters of the Atlantic and gasses up . \nThe second big factor is wind . \nStrong winds in the upper air disperse tropical waves , disrupting hurricane formation and scattering pent-up heat . \nThe NHC is predicting much more favorable wind patterns this year than last year -- La Nina or neutral conditions , as opposed to the El Nino conditions of strong winds from last year . \n`` In order to make a hurricane go , the heat coming from the ocean and released in a rising motion in the atmosphere has to be concentrated in one place . \nIf winds in the atmosphere are blowing in different directions , that disperses heat . '' \nSo having uniform winds is important -- and a rare event . \nDry air also means water vapor ca n't condense , clouds do n't gather , rain does n't fall and hurricanes do n't form . \nA third factor is the cyclical nature of the weather . \nHurricane activity tends to run in long , 20 - to 30-year cycles . \nSince 1995 , we 've been in a cycle of increased activity . \nAlex did n't move over the Gulf oil spill directly , so scientists and meteorologists were unable to directly observe the effects of the weather on the oil . \nBut Franklin thinks we 'll see winds dispersing the oil -- something BP has actively tried to do itself . \nIn that sense , hurricane season may be a blessing for the oil crisis . \n`` If the storm tracks to the west of the oil , there is the potential that the counter-clockwise circulation of the hurricane could drive some of the oil further toward the U.S. Gulf Coast . \nAlternatively , a storm tracking to the east of the oil could push the oil further offshore . \nBut , little is understood about the interaction of tropical cyclones and oil , '' the scientists write . \nFortunately , there 's no evidence to suggest storms will suck the crude into the clouds , creating a foul rain of oil on coasts . \nBut weather forecasters do n't know enough at present to really predict what will happen . \nAnd Franklin is optimistic that BP technicians will cap the well and clean the oil before what-ifs turn into learning situations . \n`` Hopefully we wo n't learn anything about it .

'' \nReacting to the speech , the head of the opposition Syrian National Council , Burhan Ghalioun , said Mr Assad 's emphasis on restoring order `` means he is backing away from his own pledge to the Arab League plan '' . \nMr Ghalioun said the anti-terrorist measures announced by Mr Assad `` undercut any Arab or non-Arab initiative to find a political solution to the crisis '' . \nThe Local Co-ordination Committees , a network of anti-government activists , said 35 protesters had been killed on Tuesday , including 17 in the eastern city of Deir al-Zour . \nThe UN says 400 people have been killed by security forces since the start of the observer mission . \nLast month the UN put the death toll since March at 5,000 . \nIn his speech , Mr Assad lashed out at the Arab League , which suspended Syria in November and imposed sanctions , saying : `` We were surprised Arabs did not stand with Syria '' . \nHe said Arab countries that opposed Syria were under outside pressure , which was undermining their sovereignty . \nBut , he added , Syria would not `` close its doors '' to an Arab solution as long as `` it respects Syria 's sovereignty '' . \nThere were no obstacles to a multi-party system , he said , adding that it was a question of time . \nMr Assad said he welcomed the idea of expanding the government to include `` all political forces '' . \nA referendum on a new constitution could be held in March , he said , paving the way for elections in May or June . \nSyria is ruled by the Baath party , dominated by President Assad 's family and the minority Alawite sect , an offshoot of Shia Islam . \nHe took power in 2000 after the death of his father Hafez al-Assad , who ruled Syria for 40 years . \n`` I rule with the will of the people , '' he said . \n`` If I give up power , I will do so with the will of the people too .

\nWell , it could reform the IMF , which has evolved from its original role into a rescue fund for collapsing currencies . \nDuring the emerging market crises of a decade ago , the IMF was central to all the bailouts . \nIts status has since dwindled . \nAs my Council on Foreign Relations colleague Brad Setser notes , the Chinese have tried to muscle in on the IMF 's turf by helping Pakistan . \nThe Russians have tried to help Iceland . \nThe European Union has helped Hungary . \nReestablishing the IMF as the agreed provider of bailouts would be a worthwhile project . \nThe IMF puts economic conditions on its loans while governments place political ones ; we do n't want to revive the cronyism of the Cold War , when countries from Cuba to Zaire could pursue absurd policies and know they would be bailed out because they were strategically useful . \nThe irony is that Britain and France will be the first to resist a serious effort to revive the IMF . \nBritish Prime Minister Gordon Brown talks vacuously about giving the organization the role of creating an early-warning system for crises , even though this is what thousands of economic forecasters already try to provide . \nWhat Brown does not stress is that serious IMF reform needs to begin with the modernization of its board . \nRising powers such as China and India deserve more say . \nDeclining powers need to give up some influence -- and that includes France and Britain . \nOf course there is a role for global cooperation . \nThe coordinated interest rate cuts and bank rescues of recent days have been constructive . \nBut it 's worth remembering that after the last global crisis , in 1997-98 , there was lots of grand talk about a new international financial architecture . \nIn the end , the only important reforms were national ones . \nGovernments ran budget surpluses and built up foreign reserves to protect themselves from the next shock . \nThat shock has arrived , and we are about to find out if those changes were enough . \nOne thing is certain : They were not the result of any international conference .

'' \nNo one could accuse Peter Mandelson of ambiguity when he said that , nor deny that his party has lived up to that precept . \nThe Blair government worships money and adores the rich , something Labor MPs try ineffectually to disguise when they attack the traditional -LRB- though long since eclipsed -RRB- values and mores of the old gentry . \nClass conflict has given way to `` culture wars '' , and hunting is a cultural and not a political question . \nIt certainly has nothing to do with left and right , unless one were to suppose that the `` Blairite loyalist '' and fanatical exponent of the hunting ban Sir Gerald Kaufman is further to the left of that hard man to hounds Friedrich Engels , which does n't seem very likely . \nAll that is overshadowed by Blair 's sordid dealings with the party he leads but which has never really liked him . \nWhen the prime minister returned from sojourning in Bermuda last year to announce his ludicrous volte-face on the European referendum , he is supposed to have told a colleague : `` I 'm going to have a lot of shit to eat '' . \nMaybe so , but nothing compared with the diet he has imposed on his party for the past 10 years , that mighty coprophagic banquet , that great orgy of ordure . \nOver and again , and to a degree quite unprecedented in political history , Labor MPs have been ordered to support ministers they despised and vote for measures they have detested . \nThe cut in benefit for single parents mattered much less economically than psychologically . \nWith that , Blair showed that he had completely broken the will of his MPs , who would thereafter accept anything - even a war that almost none of them wanted . \nAt the same time , hunting was brought back at regular intervals to propitiate the resentful and self-hating parliamentary party . \nMany people , among them Jackie Ashley and Polly Toynbee on these pages , have asked the same thing : why on earth was so much time spent on hunting when parliament had so many more important questions to deal with ? \nBut that has been answered by another eminent political journalist . \nFor those who do n't know the figures , by the way , more than 700 hours of parliamentary time were devoted to the hunting ban , as against seven hours spent on the decision to invade Iraq , a comparison that sums up the way we are governed . \nOn the evening the ban was passed , Martha Kearney on Newsnight described the political background , and the government 's motives last year in taking up the hunting bill once again . \nAs she said quite matter-of-factly , `` it was brought back to restore morale after the war in Iraq '' . \nSo there you have it . \nThis was a crust thrown to Labor MPs to thank them for supporting an unnecessary , illegal and immoral war , which Blair took this country into simply to demonstrate his uncritical loyalty to the most reactionary American president in living memory , and which has killed at least 20,000 and possibly 100,000 innocent people . \nAs the election approaches , with a further drop in turn-out all too likely , politicians are wondering why they are so widely despised . \nHere is their answer . \nBlair got his war , Labor got their hunting ban . \nI hope it makes them all happy . \nGeoffrey Wheatcroft 's book , The Strange Death of Tory England , will be published next month Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : This article was published on guardian .

'' \nPolonsky 's move , suspending more than 80 percent of his company 's portfolio of projects , is one of many signs that the global turmoil that has pummeled the stock markets and banking system here is also beginning to be felt in the rest of the Russian economy , especially a real estate sector that has been soaring for more than a decade . \nRussia 's leading stock markets crashed again Monday , suffering another record one-day loss and hitting three-year lows . \nThe benchmark MICEX and RTS indexes plunged 19 percent as regulators repeatedly suspended trading in an attempt to slow the free fall . \nThe markets are down nearly two-thirds from their highs in May . \nMeanwhile , the Russian banking system is enduring a severe liquidity crisis triggered by a flight of capital and foreign loans . \nPrime Minister Vladimir Putin has responded by tapping the government 's immense cash reserves , built up during the long oil boom , and injecting as much as $ 100 billion into the financial system . \nThe crisis has not been felt by much of Russian society . \nOnly a fraction of the public invests in the stock markets , and the Kremlin 's moves to support the banks have prevented any run on deposits . \nBut there are hints of trouble . \nInflation is rising , industrial production is shrinking and several firms have said they are cutting bonuses or laying off staff . \nThe impact of the crisis is clearest in real estate construction , one of the fastest-growing segments of the economy over the past few years but also one of the most heavily dependent on bank loans . \nWith credit disappearing , other developers have joined Polonsky in announcing plans to halt construction . \nOne of the hardest hit is Sistema Hals , the construction firm owned by Vladimir Yevtushenkov , the politically connected billionaire who also counts Russia 's top cellular provider among his assets . \nSistema Hals , which had borrowed heavily to gain market share , now plans to unload a quarter of its portfolio to raise up to $ 500 million to pay down debts . \n`` Our clients are panicking , and that is affecting our business , '' said Dmitri Lutsenko , a member of Polonsky 's board of directors , adding that the interest rates demanded by Russian banks for loans have nearly tripled to about 25 percent and that the terms offered are shorter . \n`` Given the environment , it 's a good time to be cautious .

'' \nThe University of South Florida team of scientists said they were concerned that oil was still washing up on beaches in parts of Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and the Florida panhandle . \n`` The idea that 75 % of the oil is gone and of no concern for the environment is just absolutely incorrect , '' said Charles Hopkinson , a marine science professor at the university . \nAnd the Gulf Coast Fund , a citizens ' group , maintains that oil is still washing ashore in Louisiana , Mississippi , Alabama and the Florida panhandle . \n`` Just because the oil is no longer on the surface , it does not indicate the area is healthy , '' said Wilma Subra , a chemist advising the group . \n`` We 've received reports from residents all along the coast who continue to see oil on and off shore , as well as reports of hundreds of dead fish , crabs , birds , dolphins , and other sea life .

'' \nCritics , however , accused Sarkozy of doing too little , too late . \n`` These are baby measures , not in proportion to the problem , '' said S gol ne Royal , the Socialist Party candidate who lost to Sarkozy in the 2007 presidential election . \nSarkozy delivered his speech next to a Renault plant , signifying his recognition that the auto industry has been hit particularly hard since the financial crisis dried up credit , imperiled jobs and sapped consumer confidence . \nSales of new cars in France sank by 14 percent in November , according to the French Automobile Manufacturers Association , despite discounts of up to 20 percent . \nSeveral companies and parts suppliers have announced layoffs and cutbacks in work hours . \nAgainst that background , Sarkozy announced a rise to $ 1,250 in the government-financed rebate for people purchasing a new car to replace an old vehicle . \nA smaller rebate was already in place as an environmental measure . \nSince taking office in May 2007 , Sarkozy has promoted an effort to have French industry invest heavily in environmentally friendly products , predicting they will be highly coveted in the years to come . \nFrench businesses have been allowed tax write-offs for high-tech research , particularly research that focuses on the clean-air industry . \nThat arrangement was enhanced in the stimulus package announced in Douai ; officials said more than $ 12 billion of the new stimulus package would go to quicker reimbursement of tax credits for research-oriented investment by small and medium-size businesses . \n`` Our response to the crisis is investment , '' Sarkozy said . \nAbout a third of the stimulus package was earmarked for public works , including railroad infrastructure and low-cost housing projects . \nMost of those initiatives were planned , anyway , aides acknowledged , but the schedule was moved up to get money into the economy faster and maintain employment . \nThe Finance Ministry 's National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies reported Thursday that unemployment rose by a tenth of a percentage point in the third quarter and now affects 7.3 percent of the workforce in mainland France . \nThe numbers confirmed anecdotal reports of job losses across the country since the slowdown began . \nThe cash payment to the poor was set at $ 250 . \nIt was promised for the first quarter of 2009 , disappointing some who had expected it to be disbursed in time for Christmas . \nOfficials said the main targets were the working poor and laid-off workers , who could be expected to spend the entire sum quickly . \nSarkozy announced a separate set of measures Wednesday to boost government aid for the destitute . \nSpecial correspondent Karla Adam in London contributed to this report .

'' \nThere is particular concern about the relatively young and sometimes dysfunctional democracies that emerged after the fall of communism in Eastern Europe , where societies that endured severe hardship in the 1990s in the hope that capitalism and integration with the West would bring prosperity now face further pain . \n`` The political systems in all these countries are fragile , '' said Jonathan Eyal , director of international security studies at the Royal United Services Institute , a research group in London . \n`` There 's a long history of unfulfilled promises and frustration with the political elites going back to the Communist era . '' \nEyal warned of a revival of ethnic conflict in the region , where most countries have large minority populations , adding that tensions could rise after workers who have lost jobs in Western Europe return home . \nBut he noted that extreme nationalist movements have won only limited support in Eastern Europe in recent years . \n`` People here instinctively know the idea of a strongman who imposes order does n't work , '' he said , arguing that the region 's history with Communist rule , its integration with the European Union and its anxiety about Russia 's intentions make a turn toward authoritarianism unlikely . \n`` They have seen the past , and a return to previous populist schemes is n't very persuasive . \nAt the end of the day , they know there 's no alternative to the market economy . '' \nThat assessment rings true in Latvia , where the government 's approval ratings have fallen as low as 10 percent -- the worst in the European Union , and lower than at any other time in the nation 's post-Soviet history -- but where people scoff when asked if they want to abandon markets and political freedoms . \nMultimedia reports on the struggle for equality around the globe .

'' \nNATO said its air strikes against government armor , which have recently increased , would continue as long as Gaddafi targeted civilians . \nA resident of the coastal city of Misrata , which has been under siege for six weeks , told Reuters heavy fighting was under way on the eastern approaches and in the center . \nRebels told Reuters Gaddafi 's forces fired Russian-made Grad rockets into the city , where conditions for civilians are said to be desperate . \nEarlier Al Jazeera television quoted a rebel spokesman as saying five people died and 20 were wounded in Misrata , a lone rebel bastion in western Libya . \nZuma did not travel from Tripoli to Benghazi with other AU delegates , to the rebels ' surprise , but issued a statement when he got home saying the mission was `` a huge success '' . \nLibyan officials have repeatedly said that Gaddafi , who holds no official state position , will not quit . \nThe AU delegation was met in Benghazi by up to 3,000 demonstrators holding banners reading : `` African Union take Gaddafi with you '' and `` Gaddafi has committed genocide '' . \nThey pushed up to the doors of the hotel where the talks were held , yelling `` the people want the downfall of the regime '' . \nOfficials from NATO , which is bombing Libyan government armor under a United Nations mandate to protect civilians , said they took note of the African Union plan but the alliance would continue operations while civilians were at risk . \nHuman Rights Watch accused Gaddafi 's forces of indiscriminate attacks on civilians in Misrata which violated international law . \nIt said about 250 people had died . \nThe African Union does not have a good track record in brokering peace deals , having failed recently to end conflicts or disputes in Somalia , Madagascar and Ivory Coast . \nAt the front outside the eastern rebel-held town of Ajdabiyah , rebels buried the charred bodies of Gaddafi troops killed in air strikes and said they were advancing westwards . \nBut there were only light skirmishes on Monday on the contested road to the oil port of Brega , 70 kms -LRB- 45 miles -RRB- further west , in contrast to Sunday 's heavy fighting in Ajdabiyah when rebels repelled a government assault . \nNATO stepped up attacks on Gaddafi 's armor over the weekend , destroying 25 tanks around Misrata and Ajdabiyah after rebels accused them of acting too slowly . \nAn AU statement after the Tripoli talks spoke of a transition but made no mention of Gaddafi 's future . \nAsked if the issue of him stepping aside was discussed , Ramtane Lamamra , AU Commissioner for Peace and Security , told reporters : `` There was some discussion .

'' \nLord Goldsmith 's full advice ruled out self-defence and humanitarian motives for war . \nIt instead examined and gave support to the argument that resolution 1441 of November 2002 had revived the authority of UN security council Resolution 678 in 1990 to go to war with Saddam Hussein if he had not stuck to the 1991 ceasefire . \n`` Once he advised that , the question for everybody was political , '' Mr Blair said today . \n`` Did we think we should proceed , notwithstanding the fact we could not get a second UN resolution ? \n`` And I took the view then , I take it now , that it was better for this country 's security , and the security of the world , to remove Saddam and put him in prison rather than have him in power . '' \nThe legal advice , however , said that the lawfulness of military action depended on the question of what was proportionate to disarm Iraq . \n`` Regime change can not be the objective of military action , '' Lord Goldsmith wrote . \nMr Blair was backed up on stage by the chancellor , Gordon Brown , and the trade secretary , Patricia Hewitt , as he faced questioning over whether the cabinet was aware of the full extent of the attorney general 's advice . \nMr Brown said the cabinet had `` full discussions on numerous occasions '' and saw a lengthy document on the legal issues involved before it backed the invasion . \nMr Blair said he `` took '' the cabinet through the legal issues and Ms Hewitt said Lord Goldsmith had been present at the cabinet discussions . \nLord Goldsmith 's full advice had concluded that the government would need `` hard evidence '' that Iraq was not cooperating with UN weapon inspectors if it was to argue it could go to war on the basis of past UN resolutions . \nThe 13-page minute was sent to Mr Blair on the same day that the chief UN weapons inspector , Hans Blix , declared that Iraq had made `` substantial '' progress in destroying its long-range missiles , and he found no evidence of biological or chemical weapons . \nIt appears at odds with the parliamentary answer issued by Lord Goldsmith 10 days later that concluded it was `` plain '' that Iraq was in breach of its UN disarmament obligations . \nMr Blair said evidence released by the foreign secretary , Jack Straw , on March 15 2003 had shown that Saddam was in clear breach of his UN disarmament obligations . \n`` This so-called smoking gun has turned out to be a damp squib , '' he said . \nMr Brown , meanwhile , paid tribute to the prime minister 's handling of the pre-war diplomacy . \n`` I not only trust Tony Blair but I respect Tony Blair for the way he went about that decision , '' he said . \nEarlier , the Conservative leader , Michael Howard , demanded that Mr Blair explain why Lord Goldsmith changed his legal advice and why the prime minister has repeatedly maintained that it did not change . \n`` Last night we received devastating new information which exposed that when Mr Blair said ' I have never lied ' , he was not telling the truth , '' he said . \n`` We 've been told by Mr Blair that on March 17 - just 10 days later - the advice given by the attorney general to cabinet was clear and it had n't changed . \nWe now know beyond any doubt that it had changed .

it marks a narrowing of the differences in the international community that analysts say Damascus has exploited . \nBut agreement even on this technical issue was hard won , and shows that divisions on the Council remain over the nature of the conflict . \nWestern nations were able to keep the main emphasis on the regime 's responsibilities to meet its ceasefire commitments , but Russia insisted on also including the opposition 's obligations . \nAnd it was able to soften language on the conditions needed for the observers to operate effectively - the resolution now `` calls upon '' rather than `` requires '' the government to provide full freedom of movement and access . \nAll of which suggests each step of Kofi Annan 's peace plan will be contested , not only on the ground but also in the Security Council . \nThe resolution was passed unanimously after Russia approved a revised text , which authorised the deployment of a team of about 30 unarmed observers . \nDiplomats had revised a US-proposed draft on Friday to accommodate Russian objections . \nRussia 's ambassador said Moscow supported the resolution because of the need for a rapid deployment of observers . \nIndeed the UN has said that it intends to increase the deployment to 250 - but that is dependent on certain conditions and will require further approval . \nMeanwhile the BBC 's Jim Muir in Beirut , who has been monitoring developments in Syria , says that in parts of the country the ceasefire seems to be in danger of collapsing , unless something is done to shore it up . \nSaturday witnessed a surge in violence , with activists saying at least 20 people killed in several incidents around the country : In Homs activists said security forces pounded some quarters with tanks and rocket fire Violence was particularly acute in the Qarabis quarter of the city , where video from activists appeared to show immense destruction Several quarters of the city seemed to have a considerable presence of rebel fighters from the Free Syrian Army In Aleppo , in the north of the country , heavy casualties were reported from a shooting at the funeral of a protester Activists said security forces opened fire on mourners , but state television blamed armed rebels opening fire at random In Geneva , UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon welcomed the resolution and also announced that UN aid co-ordinator Valerie Amos would chair a humanitarian forum on Syria in Geneva on 20 April . \nBritish ambassador Mark Lyall Grant : '' Today 's resolution is absolutely clear about the commitments that the Syrian regime must now fulfil '' He said that about a million people had been displaced inside Syria over the past 13 months of fighting and added that many more had been forced to flee to neighbouring countries . \nMr Annan , the envoy for the UN and Arab League , drew up the plan which called for an advance monitoring team to be deployed immediately to Syria to observe compliance with the truce . \nMr Annan 's plan aims to end more than a year of violence in Syria which the UN says has killed more than 9,000 people , mostly civilians . \nThe resolution passed on Saturday expresses an intention to establish a full mission once there is a sustained cessation of violence . \nIt also puts the onus on the Syrian government to meet its ceasefire commitments . \nSyrian-led political process to address the aspirations and concerns of the Syrian people 2 . \nUN-supervised cessation of armed violence in all its forms by all parties to protect civilians 3 . \nAll parties to ensure provision of humanitarian assistance to all areas affected by the fighting , and implement a daily two-hour humanitarian pause 4 . \nAuthorities to intensify the pace and scale of release of arbitrarily detained persons 5 . \nAuthorities to ensure freedom of movement throughout the country for journalists 6 . \nAuthorities to respect freedom of association and the right to demonstrate peacefully The text `` calls upon all parties in Syria , including the opposition , immediately to cease all armed violence in all its forms . '' \nThe BBC 's Barbara Plett at the United Nations in New York says that it provides important backing to Mr Annan 's peace plan . \nSignificantly , it is the first time Security Council members have been able to overcome divisions and adopt a resolution on Syria , which is a diplomatic defeat for Damascus , she says . \nAnalysts say Russia appears to have been key to persuading President Bashar al-Assad to accept both the Annan plan and the ceasefire . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir . \n14th April 2012 - 19:53 Russia and China and Iran have supported Assad and some sent weapons . \nThey should be ashamed of themselves . \nThey are responsible for so much suffering and killing and destruction . \nDoes Russia and China and Iran think that killing 9000 people and destroying everything is better than the regime change in Libya ? \nProper governments in 2012 do not kill their own people for protesting . \n14th April 2012 - 19:18 The power of any government surely rests with the rights of its citizens . \nWhen these citizens are subjected to violence on this scale , simply for protesting their ruling government 's policies , something must be done to protect their rights . \nThere can be no excuses for what has happened in Syria . \nThe UN must take a much firmer stance . \nWhilst caution is a virtue , it is now morally redundant . \n14th April 2012 - 18:48 Sadly , I think the odds of the ceasefire holding are little to none . \nAssad knows that his only method for retaining control in the rebelling areas is fear , and the rebels are probably a little too hopeful of Western intervention if it does n't work . \nIt boils down to blood , power and revenge , and no rules have ever kept those in check . \n14th April 2012 - 18:44 the UN should send a large armed peacekeeping force in NOW . \nall of Assad 's forces should be disarmed then all the rebel forces should be disarmed then pave the way for elections -LRB- use force if thay need to -RRB- but as soon as all the heavy weapons are held by the UN then most of the govment forces would be powerless to stop the people doing what thay want 14th April 2012 - 17:59 The deployment of monitors is an imperative step . \nThe Syrian government needs to be watched like an hawk . \nIn the same breath , rebels should follow the conditions laid down by Kofi Annan . \nThere are bound to be violations from both sides . \nThe killing of civilians should stop . \nImpartial observers should report back to the Security Council . \nConcrete action should follow . \nAll posts are reactively-moderated and must obey the house rules .

'' \nSaddamaded U.S. forces for a ISIS-led attack \nGaddafi loyalists have put on many marches and demonstrations of loyalty in recent months , but hundreds if not thousands of his opponents also took to the streets in the early stages of the uprising before they were cowed . \nThe rebels will hope security forces will melt away . \nSome say Gaddafi himself might already have fled , perhaps to his hometown of Sirte or a desert base further south . \nThe long speeches at boisterous public meetings have given way to broadcast addresses delivered on scratchy telephone lines . \nBut others say the nascent uprising reported in Tripoli on Saturday night might have come too soon , with opposition forces still too far away to help . \nDespite rhetoric of taking Tripoli and ending the war in hours or days , some analysts suspect it is more likely the rebels will cement their stranglehold on the city and then see how events play out . \n`` I think they 'll wait on the outskirts and hope for either an uprising or that Gaddafi decided to call it a day and leaves , '' said David Hartwell , Middle East analyst for IHS Jane 's . \n`` If they do go in , they could find it very difficult and they will be keen to avoid that . \nIt 's relatively obvious that NATO has been providing close air support for the rebels . \n`` That 's one thing in open countryside or lightly populated areas -- although it pushes the Security Council mandate , to put it mildly -- but it would be almost impossible in Tripoli . '' \nGaddafi 's government seems keen to broker some kind of last-minute ceasefire that would keep them in power . \nBut few believe either the rebels or NATO would agree to that at this stage . \nIn Paris , a diplomatic source said rebel cells undercover in Tripoli were putting into action plans prepared months ago . \nHe said , however , the rebels were under orders not to enact revenge killings or summary executions against senior members of Gaddafi 's camp . \nSaad Djebbar , a former lawyer for the Libyan government , told Reuters he believed many key figures loyal to Gaddafi had already fled to other countries in Africa such as Niger , Mali and Chad where they had good contacts . \n`` The big sharks have already left the scene , he said . \n`` It 's not going to be Stalingrad . \nTripoli is very small . \nPeople know each other . \nPeople negotiate their way forward . \nGaddafi is bound to have some people who will put up a symbolic fight . \nBut these are mostly thugs and there is no organized force left of any size to check the rebels . '' \nIf the rebels are wrong and significant Gaddafi forces remain , strategists say they could be in serious trouble . \nUrban warfare is notoriously challenging and bloody , giving a clear advantage to the defender , while some doubt the opposition have sufficient supply lines to sustain an offensive . \n`` The costliness of urban fighting can not be overestimated , '' said political risk consultancy Stratfor in a note . \n`` Such warfare requires a well-trained force with high morale , and the rebel forces in the west are known to be few in number ... and extremely ill-trained . '' \nThe key battle now , Stratfor said , was psychological -- with the rebel agenda to paint a picture of inevitable victory that would enthuse new uprisings and prompt Gaddafi loyalists to abandon their cause to save their necks . \nMuch , of course , will depend on how Gaddafi himself chooses to play the endgame . \nHe could still perhaps go into either internal or external exile or simply try to copy Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein and disappear into the post-war chaos . \nSaddam evaded U.S. forces for months following the 2003 fall of Baghdad before they eventually tracked him down -- although most analysts believe such a scheme would prove tougher in Libya because of its more disparate geography . \nEven if opposition forces were able to take much of Tripoli relatively easily and bloodlessly , they might still struggle to take down the final remnants of the regime . \nThen , the situation could resemble that seen earlier this year in Ivory Coast , where opposition fighters loyal to Alassane Ouattara took much of the capital Abidjan but seemed unable to capture incumbent leader Laurent Gbagbo . \nIt took the actions of French helicopter gunships and troops already based in the country to eventually breach his compound and bunker , allowing his capture by local forces . \nThe International Criminal Court in The Hague indicted Gadaffi , his eldest son and spy chief for crimes committed during their initial crackdown . \nThat might yet prompt foreign military action to help the rebels capture him . \n`` I would have thought NATO would be very keen let the rebels get Gaddafi themselves as they possibly can , '' said IHS Jane 's Hartwell . \n`` But if it really came down to getting him out of a hole , you could see some Western involvement as we did in Abidjan . \nThe ICC warrant could make it justifiable in that context . '' \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThey can simply cut off Tripoli from gasoline and electricity and wait . \nThere seems to be enthusiasm in western media for the regime 's collapse , and this irrationally translates proximity of rebel forces to Tripoli into their imminent success . \nThe regime seems poised to fall , but it wo n't come from gun-toting , untrained , western-backed rebels on the capitol 's fringes . \nThe regime will fall when there is a mass popular uprising in the city , and when deals have been struck between high-level military leaders and -LRB- mostly external -RRB- parties that have an interest in the regime 's collapse . \nNo patriot can give up a throne without a strong fight . \nNATO 's approach was lopsided and propelled a rebel group to try and take over so that NATO has puppets in power . \nGreed , barbarism led NATO to twist the UN mandate . \nThe leaders in NATO countries could not allow for a better solution , they seem to have no regard for casualties of African or third world countries as long as the strategic interest of the west and achieved . \nNATO must let Libyans settle there own problems without ludicrous foreign interference with bombs . \nUN needs to stop this war now , if it really has any worth as a world and not a club for the western countries This discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "The rebels aim to take Tripoli, but they might struggle to defeat Gaddafi's forces without NATO air support.

'' \nand `` The people want the president to be judged ! '' \nSome waved shoes in the air -- a deep insult in the Arab world -- and said they would continue their demonstrations until Mubarak quits outright . \nMohamed ElBaradei , the Nobel Peace Prize winner who has become a leading opposition figure , said Mubarak 's decision was `` an act of deception '' that would only `` extend the agony .

'' \nIt comes less than three weeks after a wave of protests that forced Tunisia 's longtime strongman to flee to Saudi Arabia in mid-January . \nProtesters last week taunted , `` Mubarak , Saudi Arabia is waiting for you . '' \nBut despite calls for him to leave the country , the aging leader vowed Tuesday that `` This dear country is my country ... and I will die on its land .

'' \nShibley Telhami , a University of Maryland professor and Brookings Institution analyst , said the military may have anchored the government but , `` At some point , they are going to have to make a decision about protecting the institution beyond the man . '' \nAnd Fouad Ajami , a Johns Hopkins University professor and Hoover Institution analyst , said Mubarak 's invocation of his years of service was `` almost pathetic . '' \n`` I believe the crowd was discovering its power as Mubarak was discovering his own weakness and the vulnerability of his own regime , '' Ajami said . \nNow , `` No one believes his promises , and now no one really believes his threats . '' \nThe demonstrations had turned ugly last Friday , when thousands of riot and plainclothes police used brutal force to crack down on people on the streets . \nUnconfirmed reports suggest up to 300 people may have been killed during the protests , U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay said Tuesday . \nHuman Rights Watch has reported 80 deaths from two hospitals in Cairo , 36 in Alexandria and 13 in Suez . \nCNN has not been able to independently confirm the death toll . \nBut since the weekend , the army has replaced police as the enforcers of security , and the gatherings have been largely peaceful . \nIn recent days , protests inspired by the Tunisian outcome have spread to Algeria , Yemen , Jordan and Sudan . \nCalls for political reform prompted Jordan 's King Abdullah II Tuesday to dismiss his government and appoint a new prime minister , and a Facebook page urged similar demonstrations in Syria . \nJohn Entelis , director of Middle East studies at New York 's Fordham University , said the Arab world is facing a `` wave '' of unrest sparked by the Tunisian revolt . \n`` If it were not for Tunisia , none of this would be happening at this time or in this way , '' Entelis said . \nCNN 's John King , Ben Wedeman , Frederik Pleitgen , Ivan Watson , Housam Ahmed , Caroline Faraj , Salma Abdelaziz , Saad Abedine , Christine Theodorou , Zain Verjee , Arwa Damon and journalist Ian Lee contributed to this report ", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak has announced that he will not seek re-election in the upcoming elections, sparking widespread protests and clashes across the country.

'' \nMORE MONEY MAY BE NEEDED Feinberg told CBS News on Friday $ 20 billion may not be enough to meet all legitimate claims . \n`` No one knows for sure yet , but the president made clear , and as I understand it BP went along , that if $ 20 billion is not enough , there will be additional funds provided , '' he said . \nAfter falling 6.8 percent in a week of volatility driven by politics in Washington , BP 's U.S.-listed shares hovered nearly unchanged on Friday . \nThe shares are down 26 percent so far in June , their worst month since the October 1987 market crash . \nInvestors appeared unimpressed by BP chief executive Tony Hayward 's performance at a U.S. congressional hearing on Thursday . \nLawmakers accused him of being evasive and of failing to take responsibility for the spill . \n`` Hayward 's performance was n't great , but it could have been worse . \nAs a shareholder , our absolute top priority is to see that all energies are being diverted to cap this wretched well , '' said one top 10 investor . \nInvestors and analysts said Hayward may cling on despite calls by some U.S. lawmakers for BP to `` clean house , '' but the future was less certain for Svanberg , who earlier in the week described those hurt by the oil spill as `` small people , '' for which he later apologized . \nSome shareholders say changing BP 's leadership now would be counterproductive when it is in the midst of a battle to cap its blown-out Macondo well . \nBP hopes a pair of relief wells now being drilled will halt the leak in August . \nThe aim is for one or both relief wells to intersect with the leaking well at its bottom to pump in heavy drilling fluids and cement to seal it . \nThe first relief well is within 200 feet of the side of the blown well , said Kent Wells , BP 's senior vice president of exploration and production . \nBut it must be drilled down farther before it can intersect with the blown well . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nI am tired of passing blame down to low level employees . \nIt 's pressure from the top to squeeze out more profits that create the environment that makes middle and lower level managers make really bad decisions . \nThey make them based on the resources and time they are provided , and when those get squeezed , it 's comes right from the top . \nIf there is n't a law that will put this guy in jail , there dam well should be . \nWhere is the outrage at the GO -LRB- B -RRB- P defense of BP ? \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "BP is responsible for the Gulf oil spill and should pay for the damages.", "prop_score_1": 0.7, "generate_explanation_1": "The original sentence places blame on BP and emphasizes the need for financial responsibility.

Gaddafi forces are shelling Misrata from three sides : east , west and south , '' rebel spokesman Hassan al-Misrati told Reuters from inside the besieged town . \n`` He has sent thousands of troops from all sides and they are trying to enter the city . \nThey are still outside , though .

'' \n`` The way it 's heading is more toward full scale civil war which draws in the intervention of regional actors .

'' \n`` The question is , the bits that it ca n't hold , are they ever going to be retaken by the government ? \nAnd my suspicion is , they are not , '' he said , referring to areas around the southern city of Deraa and the central city of Homs . \nJoshi expects `` a stalemate '' between the two sides where the government can not retake land it has lost but the insurgents can not challenge the army in areas they would like to take . \n-LRB- Reporting by William Maclean ; Editing by Jon Hemming -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "The Syrian army defections do not yet pose a mortal threat to President Bashar al-Assad, but outside support could turn the dissidents into a national insurgency capable of harassing and exhausting his military.", "prop_score_1": 0.5, "generate_explanation_1": "The original text uses a neutral tone and provides factual information about the growing number of Syrian army defections and the potential impact on President Assad's regime.

'' \nWhen the rebels returned , a fierce exchange of rockets and mortar bombs ensued just outside Bin Jawad with the army also using heavy artillery . \nBehind rebel lines , hundreds of fighters armed with machine guns and assault rifles waited to advance . \n`` The firing is sustained , there is the thud of shells landing , the whoosh of rockets , puffs of smoke and heavy machine gun fire in the distance , '' a Reuters correspondent there said . \nThe rebels said they had shot down a helicopter on Sunday and Reuters was shown the wreckage of a warplane on Saturday near Ras Lanuf that rebels said they had brought down . \nDoctors at Ras Lanuf hospital said two dead and 22 wounded had arrived from the fighting . \nA French journalist was shot in the leg , a doctor said , and four rebels were seriously wounded and unlikely to survive . \nBritain 's Foreign Secretary William Hague said on Sunday that what he called a British diplomatic team that had been captured in the eastern city of Benghazi have now left Libya . \nThe Sunday Times earlier reported a British Special Air Service -LRB- SAS -RRB- unit had been captured after a secret diplomatic mission to make contact with opposition leaders backfired . \n`` They -LRB- the rebel army -RRB- did capture some British special forces . \nThey could not ascertain if they were friends or foes . \nFor our safety we are holding them and we expect this situation to be resolved soon , '' a rebel source in Benghazi said . \nWestern leaders have denounced what they call Gaddafi 's brutal response to the uprising , and the International Criminal Court said he and his inner circle face investigation for alleged targeting of civilians by his security forces . \nGerman Foreign Minister Guido Westerwelle said in a newspaper on Sunday that the United Nations security council should launch fresh sanctions against Gaddafi . \n`` Selective sanctions are necessary against those who are responsible for crimes against the Libyan people , '' he told the Welt am Sonntag newspaper . \n`` The flow of money must be cut off .

There has to be reconciliation , '' he said . \nIt is difficult to tell how widespread Farisi 's views are , but his conciliatory tone is echoed by many others in the east including the rebel leadership , whose National Transitional Council on Saturday offered an amnesty to Gaddafi supporters who defect . \nIn Benghazi , the bodies of dead Gaddafi soldiers and those of rebels that fought against them are buried in the same cemetery . \nThey are washed according to Islamic ritual and prayers are said for all , cemetery and morgue workers said . \n`` We do n't have the custom of ` These are Gaddafi 's people , throw them over there ' . \nThey 're all martyrs , and they 're buried together with our martyrs , '' said grave digger Ghaith Hussein . \n`` These people were just following orders ...

'' \nObama defended the role of government in the recovery process , saying that `` with the private sector so weakened by this recession , the federal government is the only entity left with the resources to jolt our economy back to life . '' \nThe president fielded 13 questions from reporters in his first wide-ranging session since he took office , touching briefly on foreign policy , his long-range agenda and sports . \nBut the economy dominated the event . \nAsked about the next allotment of money to aid troubled banks , he said he is dissatisfied with the way the first $ 350 billion was spent . \n`` We did n't get as big a bang for the buck as we should have '' from the Troubled Assets Relief Program , Obama said . \n`` My immediate task is making sure that the second half of that money -- $ 350 billion -- is spent properly . '' \nThat allocation process will begin today , when Treasury Secretary Timothy F. Geithner is slated to detail the administration 's strategy for releasing the remaining bailout money . \nObama stepped to the podium in the East Room of the White House at 8:01 p.m. , opening with prepared remarks on the economy that set the tone for the night . \nSomber and focused , he alternated between defending some specific provisions of the legislation and discussing its broad framework , repeatedly arguing that the public would prefer even a flawed government response over inaction . \nHe said he thought an economic recovery could begin to set in by 2010 but warned that 2009 will continue to be a `` difficult year . '' \nHe did not crack any jokes , aside from a playful greeting of veteran reporter Helen Thomas , and ended the appearance promptly at 9 p.m. Still , the president conveyed a firm tone . \nAsked whether he risked appearing to be too much of an alarmist about the economic peril facing the United States , possibly undermining public confidence in the system , he became almost defensive . \n`` No , no , no , no , '' he said . \n`` I think that what I 've said is what other economists have said across the political spectrum , which is that if you delay acting on an economy of this severity , then you potentially create a negative spiral that becomes much more difficult for us to get out of . '' \nHe compared the situation to that of Japan in the 1990s , saying the Japanese , failing to act quickly enough , suffered a `` lost decade . '' \n`` This is not your ordinary , run-of-the-mill recession , '' he said . \nIn a brief foray into foreign policy , Obama said with regard to Iran that the administration `` will be looking for openings that can be created where we can start sitting across the table , face-to-face diplomatic overtures '' with the Islamic republic . \nHe said that `` there 's been a lot of mistrust built up over the years , so it 's not going to happen overnight '' and that `` even as we engage in this direct diplomacy , we are very clear about certain deep concerns '' about Iranian links to militant groups and possible pursuit of a nuclear weapon . \nIn stark contrast to former president George W. Bush , Obama did not say that the United States would refuse to tolerate a nuclear-armed Iran . \nInstead , he all but invited Iran to signal that it , too , is interested in talks . \n`` Now it 's time for Iran to send some signals that it wants to act differently , as well , and recognize that , even as it has some rights as a member of the international community , with those rights come responsibilities , '' he said . \nThe news conference ended a day of action on the stimulus package : Obama traveled to Elkhart , Ind. , to promote the legislation as it made its way toward the Senate floor , clearing a procedural hurdle by a vote of 61 to 36 that set the stage for final passage today . \nOnly three Republicans -- moderate Sens. Susan Collins and Olympia J. Snowe of Maine and Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania -- supported the legislation . \nIn the House , no Republicans voted for the $ 819 billion version of the stimulus package that passed on Jan. 28 .

\nNothing is wrong with genuine efforts at understanding ; on these we all depend . \nBut the genuine article is one thing , and root-causes advocacy seeking to dissipate responsibility for atrocity , mass murder , crime against humanity , especially in the immediate aftermath of their occurrence , is something else . \nNote the selectivity in the way root-causes arguments function . \nPurporting to be about causal explanation rather than excuse-making , they are invariably deployed on behalf of movements or actions for which their proponent wants to engage our indulgence , and in order to direct blame towards some party towards whom he or she is unsympathetic . \nA hypothetical example illustrates the point . \nSuppose that , on account of the present situation in Zimbabwe , the government decides to halt all scheduled deportations of Zimbabweans . \nSome BNP thugs are made angry by this and express their anger by beating up a passer-by who happens to be an African immigrant . \nCan you imagine a single person of left or liberal outlook who would blame this act of violence on the government 's decision or urge us to consider sympathetically the root causes of the act ?

Mary Landry said . \nIn their worst-case scenario , BP executives told members of a congressional committee that up to 2.5 million gallons a day could spill if the leaks worsened , though it would be more like 1.7 million gallons . \nIn an exploration plan filed with the government in February 2009 , BP said it could handle a `` worst-case scenario '' it described as a leak of 6.8 million gallons per day from an uncontrolled blowout . \nContainment boxes have never been tried at this depth -- about 5,000 feet -- because of the extreme water pressure . \nIf all goes well , the contraption could be fired up early next week to start funneling the oil into a tanker . \n`` We do n't know for sure '' whether the equipment will work , said BP spokesman Bill Salvin . \n`` What we do know is that we have done extensive engineering and modeling and we believe this gives us the best chance to contain the oil , and that 's very important to us . '' \nThe seas calmed Tuesday , allowing more conventional methods to contain the spill to get back on track as businesses and residents kept an eye on the ocean currents , wondering when the sheen washing ashore in places might turn into a heavier coating of oil . \nCrews put out more containment equipment and repaired some booms damaged in rough weather over the weekend . \nThey also hoped to again try to burn some of the oil on the water 's surface , possibly Wednesday . \nChemical dispersants piped 5,000 feet to the main leak have significantly reduced the amount of oil coming to the surface , BP said . \nFrom the air Tuesday , the site of the Deepwater Horizon explosion looked similar to a week ago except for the appearance of a massive rig brought in to drill a relief well to shut off the spewing oil . \nThat will take months . \nPeople along the Gulf Coast have spent weeks living with uncertainty , wondering where and when the huge slick might come ashore , ruining their beaches -- and their livelihoods . \nThe anxiety is so acute that some are seeing and smelling oil where there is none . \nAnd even though the dead turtles and jellyfish washing ashore along the Gulf of Mexico are clean , and scientists have yet to determine what killed them , many are just sure the flow of crude unleashed by the explosion at BP 's Deepwater Horizon is the culprit . \nThe rig was owned by Transocean Ltd. . \nSome of the 115 surviving workers who were aboard when it exploded are suing that company and BP PLC. . \nIn lawsuits filed Tuesday , three workers say they were kept floating at sea for more than 10 hours while the rig burned uncontrollably . \nThey are seeking damages . \nGuy Cantwell , a spokesman for rig owner Transocean Ltd. , defended the company 's response , saying 115 workers did get off alive . \nTwo wrongful death suits also have been filed . \nWhile officials worked on cleanup , the long wait took its toll on nerves and incomes . \nIn Gulf Shores , Ala. , the real estate firm Brett\\/Robinson Vacations sent a note to those renting vacation properties that they would not be penalized for any spill-related cancellations , but urged them not to jump the gun . \n`` There are many questions and many ` what ifs ' regarding this event , '' the message read . \n`` Because changes come about hourly and 30 days is a long way away , we are asking you to wait before canceling your vacation , especially those of you who are scheduled to arrive more than 30 days from today .

\nThe World Health Organisation declared SARS a pandemic in March 2003 . \nBy June of that year , it had lifted an advisory warning against traveling to SARS affected countries . \nThere were some 8,000 cases and close to 800 deaths . \nThe most visible impact of SARS was on tourism and consumption patterns in the most affected countries : Singapore , Hong Kong , China and Malaysia , although others in the region also suffered . \nSingapore and Hong Kong slipped into recession in 2003 . \nOther countries affected by SARS included Canada , South Africa , Sweden , France and the United States . \nDeaths were reported in Asia , Canada , France and South Africa . \nAccording to the Asian Development Bank , the cost of SARS in terms of lost GDP in nominal terms for East and Southeast Asia was about $ 18 billion or 0.6 percentage points of 2003 GDP . \nThe main channels through which SARS affected economies was through tourist arrivals . \nADB data shows a 20-70 percent drop on tourist arrivals in April 2003 in the most affected economies , while others in Asia also saw declines of 15-35 percent , leading to estimated tourism revenue losses of nearly $ 15 billion or 0.5 percent of GDP . \nSARS-affected economies experienced drops in retail sales growth in the order of 5-10 percent in early 2003 . \nHong Kong 's economy shrank 2.6 percent and Singapore 's by 2 percent in the first half of 2003 . \nOverall growth was ironically helped by a simultaneous decline in imports and investment . \nHOW DID MARKETS REACT TO SARS ? \nMarket reaction was relatively muted , possibly because the panic over SARS lasted for just about one quarter and governments reacted quickly . \nThe Singapore dollar SGD = fell nearly 4 percent against the U.S. dollar between the end of January 2003 and the end of April 2003 , but it then rallied . \nMCSI 's emerging Asia-ex-Japan index . \nMIAPJ0000PUS fell around 14 percent between January and March 2003 . \nFrom the end of March it rallied by 56 percent during the rest of the year Hong Kong 's benchmark index . \nHSI shed 18 percent of its value between December 2002 and April 2003 , bottoming at a 4-year low . \nFor a graphic on economic and market impact , click here : China had price controls for SARS-related drugs , tax waivers for affected industries such as hotels , interest subsidies for tourism sectors . \nHong Kong 's government announced a package of measures worth around 1 percent of GDP , which included tax reductions and loan guarantees . \nSingapore likewise had a SARS relief package including measures for airlines . \nIt also eased monetary policy in July 2003 by a one-off devaluation of the currency . \nMalaysia 's package was close to 2 percent of GDP and included cheaper loans , support for job training and tourism sectors . \nIS THE ECONOMIC SITUATION DIFFERENT NOW ? \nThe starting point for most economies is much lower , since the credit crisis has already plunged a lot of the developed world and countries such as Singapore , Japan and Hong Kong into recession . \nTourism received a big boost between 2004 and 2007 and is now a much bigger contributor to growth , with revenues comprising between 6 and 9 percent of GDP in Hong Kong , Malaysia , Thailand and Singapore . \nLINKS -RRB- After SARS , bird flu , Asia wary of new virus . . \n-LRB- ID : nHKG362728 -RRB- -RRB- Global fears over flu outbreak , over 100 dead . \n-LRB- ID : nN27484099 -RRB- -RRB- Asia stocks , commodities hit by flu fears ... -LRB- ID : nHKG372361 -RRB- -LRB- Editing by Neil Fullick -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "The 2003 SARS epidemic provides valuable lessons on how the world dealt with a pandemic that was spread by human-to-human contact and how it affected economies and markets.", "prop_score_1": 0.5, "generate_explanation_1": "In this rewritten sentence, I used more descriptive language to make the sentence more engaging and easier to understand.

'' \nsaid Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al-Saud , a former Saudi foreign policy adviser to King Abdullah . \n`` There is a lot of change going on , '' said Sultan bin Abdulaziz al-Saud . \nThe conservative Islamic state is at odds with its key U.S. ally over how to respond to Arab pro-democracy movements and appears to have ceded some regional leadership to Turkey , which has taken a strong line against Israel and the Syrian president . \nUsed to working back channels and shunning the limelight , the kingdom has employed pocketbook diplomacy , pledging billions of dollars to Egypt and the Palestinian Authority . \nUnderpinning Saudi concerns are its fears that the fall of established rulers after popular revolts has created strategic opportunities for Middle East rival Iran , while instability , especially in Yemen , has gifted openings to al Qaeda . \n`` Saudi Arabia is a status quo power in a region where the majority of Arabs oppose the status quo , '' said Shadi Hamid , director of research at Brookings Doha Centre . \n`` So to the extent that democratic change provides an opening for hostile forces , they oppose democracy . '' \nNowhere was that more evident than in Bahrain , where Saudi forces intervened in March to help the island 's Sunni rulers crush pro-reform demonstrations backed by the Shi'ite majority . \nThe Saudis had already been upset with the United States for failing to prevent the overthrow of Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak , whom they had seen as a vital ally against Iran . \nKing Abdullah bin Abdulaziz al-Saud , who is in his 80s , is in poor health and can not work a full day , while Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdulaziz al-Saud is abroad for medical treatment . \nThe next most senior man , Interior Minister Prince Nayef bin Abdulaziz al-Saud , weighs in on foreign policy , but has been unwell himself and has a different approach on some international issues , especially with veteran Foreign Minister Prince Saud al-Faisal , who is also unwell . \n`` King Abdullah 's the central figure and ultimately calls the shots , but he 's not in perfect health and neither are the people around him , '' said Ghanem Nuseibeh , a political analyst and partner at Cornerstone Global consultants . \n`` It 's not contributing to the Saudis ' ability to create a coherent policy and establish facts on the ground . \nThe Saudi state is becoming an inactive , passive player . '' \nAlthough both King Abdullah and Foreign Minister Prince Saud have backed the Palestinian statehood claim in prepared texts released to journalists , neither read out their remarks , which could be a sign they are not pushing the matter forcefully . \nIndeed the king only said Riyadh would join others in support of the Palestinian bid , according to published remarks . \nBy contrast , in 2002 King Abdullah proposed a peace plan offering Israel pan-Arab recognition in return for a Palestinian state . \nIt was rejected by Israel , but remains the corner-stone of Arab policy on the region 's most stubborn impasse . \nInstead of a fresh diplomatic offensive to coincide with the request for the U.N. Security Council to recognize a Palestinian state , the kingdom has worked mostly behind the scenes . \nThis month a senior Saudi prince wrote an opinion piece in the New York Times warning that Washington 's promised veto of the resolution would make its relationship with Riyadh `` toxic . '' \nPrince Turki al-Faisal , a former intelligence chief and ambassador to Washington and London , has no formal role , but his words were widely interpreted as a message from King Abdullah . \nJordan , the former U.S. envoy , said the Saudis were unlikely to risk the basic relationship with the United States over any U.N vote , suggesting their leverage on that issue was limited . \n`` They recognize how closely vital Saudi interests are tied to vital U.S. interests on a whole range of issues from counter-terrorism to Iran and maintaining a balanced price of oil , '' he said . \n`` It would be almost unthinkable for there to be a major rupture such that the two countries fail to cooperate . '' \nSaudi policy on Yemen , where more than 100 people have been killed in a week of clashes between opponents and supporters of President Ali Abdullah Saleh , also lacks force , say analysts . \nSaleh spent three months in Riyadh recuperating from an assassination attempt before returning to Sanaa on Friday . \nAny expectation that Saleh would bow out to end the crisis roiling Yemen since protests erupted in January fell flat . \nHe offered no concessions and no clear path to transfer power . \nSaudi princes have strong networks of influence throughout Yemen , which the kingdom regards as its top security risk , and have spent freely on their unruly neighbor in the past . \nHowever , while Riyadh has backed a Gulf-brokered plan for Saleh to step down , it has failed to pressure the veteran Yemeni leader to implement an orderly transfer of power . \n`` Yemen is a clear example of where the Saudi regime is unable to make a decision on what they want , '' said Nuseibeh , arguing that top Saudi figures supported rival Yemeni factions and did not know what to do with Saleh when he was in Riyadh . \nSaudi policy on Syria has also seemed half-hearted . \nIn August , King Abdullah demanded an end to the bloodshed against protesters and withdrew his ambassador to Damascus , but has not followed through , for example by pushing for Arab League measures against Syrian President Bashar al-Assad . \n-LRB- Editing by Reed Stevenson and Alistair Lyon -RRB- An ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "The Saudi royal family has long been perceived as the natural leader of the Arab world, but their ageing rulers have so far failed to take a lead role in addressing the most pressing issues facing the Middle East today.

'' \nThat was an apparent reference to the suppression of anti-government protests in Iran , the biggest since the 1979 Islamic revolution , that erupted after a disputed 2009 presidential election . \nTens of thousands of people had taken to the streets of cities across Syria in the biggest demonstrations to sweep the country so far , and called for the `` overthrow of the regime . '' \nThat reflected the hardening of demands which initially focused on reforms and greater freedoms . \nThe protests went ahead despite Assad 's lifting of the state of emergency the day before . \nEnding the hated emergency rule , in place since the Baath Party seized power 48 years ago , was a central demand of demonstrators , who also seek the release of political prisoners and dismantling of the security services . \n`` This was the first test of the seriousness of authorities -LRB- toward reform -RRB- and they have failed , '' activist Ammar Qurabi said . \nWashington urged Syria to stop the violence against protesters and British Foreign Secretary William Hague said emergency law should be `` lifted in practice not just in word . '' \nFriday 's violence brings the death toll to about 300 , according to rights activists , since the unrest which broke out on March 18 in the southern city of Deraa . \nActivists cited the highest toll in the nearby village of Izra'a where protesters had been trying to head for Deraa . \nResidents said 14 people were killed . \n`` Izra'a is in the dark . \nNo mobile phones or landlines working . \nPeople have been talking from villages near to Izra'a but not in the town , '' said Wissam Tarif of human rights organization , Insan . \nSyrian television said eight people were killed and 28 wounded , including army personnel , in attacks by armed groups in the village . \nIt added an armed group had attacked a military base in the Damascus suburb of Muadhamiya . \nAmnesty International said it had been told of 75 deaths , including two children and a 70-year-old man . \nMalcolm Smart , Amnesty International 's Middle East and North Africa director , urged the authorities to stop the violence : `` They must also immediately launch an independent investigation into what happened and ensure that any security forces found to have carried out these killings are brought to justice . '' \nAs in the Tunisian and Egyptian uprisings , citizens are rebelling against both a lack of freedom and opportunity and security forces ' impunity and corruption that has enriched the elite while one-third of Syrians live below the poverty line . \nIn the first joint statement since the protests broke out , the activists coordinating the demonstrations Friday demanded the abolition of the Baath Party monopoly on power and the establishment of a democratic political system . \nAided by his family and a pervasive security apparatus , Assad , 45 , has absolute power in Syria . \nProtests swept the country of 20 million people , from the Mediterranean city of Banias to the eastern towns of Deir al-Zor and Qamishli . \nIn Damascus , security forces fired teargas to disperse 2,000 protesters in the district of Midan . \nIn Hama , where Assad 's father crushed an armed Islamist revolt in 1982 , a witness said security forces opened fire to prevent protesters reaching the Baath Party headquarters . \n`` We saw two snipers on the building . \nNone of us had weapons . \nThere are casualties , possibly two dead , '' said the witness . \nSyria 's third city Homs , where security forces had killed 21 protesters this week when demonstrators tried to gather at a main square , was not spared Friday either . \n`` I was in the center of Homs and in front of me I heard a security commander telling his armed men : ` Do n't spare them -LRB- protesters -RRB- , ' '' rights campaigner Najati Tayara told Reuters . \nWitnesses said security forces also shot at protesters in the Damascus district of Barzeh and the suburb of Douma . \nAl Jazeera showed footage of three corpses , wrapped in white burial shrouds , which it said were from the eastern Damascus suburb of Zamalka . \nAhead of the main weekly prayers Friday , which have often turned out to be launch pads for major demonstrations , the army deployed in Homs and police put up checkpoints across Damascus , apparently trying to prevent protests sweeping in from suburbs . \nAfter prayers finished in Deraa , several thousand protesters gathered chanting anti-Assad slogans . \n`` The Syrian people will not be subjugated . \nGo away doctor -LRB- Assad -RRB- . \nWe will trample on you and your slaughterous regime , '' they shouted . \nAssad 's conciliatory move to lift the state of emergency followed a familiar pattern since the unrest began a month ago : pledges of reform are made before Friday when demonstrations are the strongest , usually followed by an intense crackdown . \nActivists said some funerals for those killed Friday took place in Damascus suburbs in the evening . \nFunerals have been another platform for protesters in recent weeks and security forces have opened fire when mourners started demonstrating . \nThe authorities have blamed armed groups , infiltrators and Sunni Muslim militant organizations for provoking violence at demonstrations by firing on civilians and security forces . \nWestern and other Arab countries have mostly muted their criticism of the killings in Syria for fear of destabilizing the country , which plays a strategic role in many of the conflicts in the Middle East . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThey want the nation broken into cultural enclaves protected by small militias . \nNational boundaries in North Africa have got to go , they are a stranglehold on multi-cultural needs . \nThe Bathist party is among the most ruthless in history and this al-assad junior is no better than his father . \nThey try to mask their identities with degrees and overseas educations , but unfortunately , you can take them out of the gutter but you cant take the gutter out of them . \nEven more sad in the region is that without these ruthless dictators , you would have complete anarchy in the streets . \nToo many different sects\\/tribes and interests . \nEveryone in the region is worried about their personal benefit first and not that of the common good . \nThe Middle East is a hopeless cause and the sooner we pull out the more we can focus on our own problems here . \nTaking out these monkeys will only create larger struggles for power which will lead to more dictators and more bloodshed . \nJust let these people alone and if they kill themselves , than that is their chosen fate . \nThe Arab Spring to democracy must be worrying to Israel which depends on Arab tyrannies and the anti-Israel threat they pose militarily to keep Israel from descending into civil war . \nWithout enemies that is almost certain to happen in Israel , especially if the Arab Spring Democracy Movement also gains hold and wins in the Palestinian territories , leaving only Iran as the big threat unless democracy also takes control in Persia . \nWith that scenario in mind , I wonder what plans the United States has in place to deal with a potential new reality which will see its allied countries like Saudi Arabia and other oil producing sheikdoms the only major anti-democratic and anti-Israel tyrannies left in the region . \nThe next six to 36-months may reshape everything including Israel and the way it governs

'' \nColonel Hamed Al-Hasi , commander of the anti-Gaddafi Qatar brigade east of Sirte , said the truce had expired Sunday , but a full assault was still out of the question . \n`` There are still more than 15,000 persons inside . \nWe can not sacrifice them , '' he said . \nHe said NTC forces would for now instead be targeting the district of Bouhadi , just to the south of Sirte . \nHe said a captured Gaddafi loyalist had told them that Mo'atassem , one of the deposed Libyan leader 's sons and his former national security adviser , was in the district . \n`` We 've been concentrating since last night on Bouhadi , '' he said . \n`` If we catch Mo'atassem , things will calm down . '' \nNATO warplanes were more in evidence than in previous days , with aircraft flying unusually low over the city . \nIn one 10-minute period there was a steady rumble from bombs dropping on an area south of the city , a Reuters reporter said . \nLibyans ended Gaddafi 's 42-year rule in August when rebel fighters stormed the capital . \nGaddafi and several of his sons are still at large , and his supporters hold Sirte and the town of Bani Walid , south of Tripoli . \nGaddafi 's supporters are too weak to regain power , but their resistance is frustrating the new rulers ' efforts to start building the post-Gaddafi Libya . \nWhile it needs to stamp out the last resistance swiftly , the NTC does not want to use indiscriminate shelling , which could hurt its standing and make it even harder to govern Libya 's fractious tribes and regions . \nGaddafi loyalists and some civilians have blamed NATO air strikes and shelling by anti-Gaddafi forces for the deaths of civilians in Sirte . \nBoth NATO and the NTC deny that and say it is the Gaddafi loyalists who are endangering civilians by using them as human shields . \nKhalid Ahmed , who fled the city early Sunday , said the residential area where he lives in the center of Sirte had come under heavy artillery fire Saturday . \n`` The reason there is shooting in the city center is that the pro-Gaddafi militia has positioned artillery in the buildings where civilians live . \nThe children are terrified and they are screaming all the time . '' \nHe said he had been able to get out by borrowing money to buy black-market fuel . \nHe said the rate in Sirte now was 600 dinars , or about $ 450 , for 20 litres of fuel . \nDoctors at a field hospital east of Sirte said four NTC fighters had been killed Sunday in `` friendly fire '' incidents -- testament to the often-chaotic conduct of the anti-Gaddafi forces . \nThe focus on the battle for the last pro-Gaddafi strongholds -- and on tracking down Gaddafi himself -- has left a power vacuum in Tripoli . \nWith no process in motion for electing a new leadership , power on the ground is wielded by anti-Gaddafi militias who are jockeying with each other for influence in the new Libya . \nSome analysts warn that this rivalry could turn violent . \nOne commander in Tripoli said he was setting up an armed group to keep order in the city , even though that function is already carried out by a body led by Abdulhakim Belhadj , a former militant Islamist . \n`` Who is he ? \nWho appointed him ? '' \nsaid Abdullah Ahmed Naker , the head of the new group , when asked about Belhadj . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nThe quotes in the title might make someone take this the wrong way . \nNato does n't seem to mind killing civilians who belong to tribes who wo n't succumb to it . \nThe fall of Sirte was first reported 28\\/08\\/2011 by Haaretz . \nAfter that date a stream of reports stating that surrender of the Libyan Armes Forces -LRB- LAF -RRB- was imminent and giving totally contradictory distances of the `` advancing '' rebel forces which according to BBC 29\\/08\\/2011 were 18 miles from the city center -- this figure actually increased as the days went by . \nOver a month later the same reports of an imminenet rebel victory in Sirte from the media . \nFurther , the repeated myth of only two cities still under Libyan Govt . \ncontrol just does n't fit the facts . \n80 % of the country remains under LAF control and the town of Ghadames has just been retaken by them . \nA counter offensive has been anounced by the LAF . \nKhamis Gaddafi has been reported dead at on at least 5 different occasions only to miraculously reappear sever days later idem Ibrahim Moussa . \nFrom the beginning of the civil war and intervention of Nato the rebels have been killing each other starting with the summary execution of the rebel General Younes . \nIt is clear that : 1 -RRB- The majority of Libyans are against the CNT rebels and oppose the British , French and Qattari presence . \n2 -RRB- Without Nato air support the civil war would have been over months ago and the rebels in prison . \n3 -RRB- The CNT , even with the miliary support of NATO , is a disparate puppet group representing corporate and western interests and will be incapable of governing the country -- their leaders are already resigning or grasping for power . \n4 -RRB- The inaccurate and selective reporting by the media of this civil war has directly contributed to British and French citizens accepting that their respective governments order the bombing of tens of thousands of ordinary Libyan citizens . \nWhen will the truth and ordinary Libyans become important to news publications ? \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "The article highlights the dire situation in Sirte, Libya, where medical supplies are running low, and civilians are caught in the crossfire.

'' \nGian Antonio Stella , a commentator for the Corriere della Sera newspaper , argued that Italy has to feel more responsible for a positive outcome to the Libyan crisis because Rome `` revered and adulated '' Gaddafi until only a short while ago . \nWhen the Libyan unrest broke out Berlusconi seemed almost in denial , perhaps sensing that his one-on-one style of diplomatic relations had fallen flat , as Gaddafi returned to his old habit of insulting the former colonial power . \n`` In Gaddafi 's case this -LRB- Berlusconi 's personal style produced results that were grotesque and undignified , '' wrote political commentator and former ambassador Sergio Romano . \n`` We had to put up with the capriciousness of the colonel , his delays -LRB- in 2009 he failed to show up to address parliament -RRB- his insults , his uniforms , his tents in our parks , '' Romano said . \nRome 's behavior can have far-reaching effects for Italy . \n`` Political imprudence by the government can risk unleashing resentment from whatever Libya emerges from the current crisis , '' said Aliboni of the Institute for International Affairs . \n`` National interests would be gravely put at risk . '' \nIt is no surprise that Italy is no cheerleader for sanctions against Libya or of calls for the freezing of its assets or the imposition of a no-fly zone . \nRome has made clear that it is not considering unilaterally freezing Libyan holdings in Italian companies at present . \nLibya owns stakes in blue-chip Italian companies including bank UniCredit and defense company Finmeccanica , and the fate of its holdings have been under scrutiny since the European Union imposed sanctions on Libya . \nThe EU agreed last week to freeze the assets of Gaddafi and a list of senior Libyan officials after Libyan security forces used violence to crack down on protesters . \nBut since that list does not mention the country 's sovereign wealth fund , the Libyan Investment Authority -LRB- LIA -RRB- , or the Libyan central bank -- entities that hold stakes in Italian companies -- Italy does not plan to freeze the holdings , a source familiar with the matter told Reuters . \nThe question is where do the assets of Gaddafi and his family end and where do Libya 's assets begin . \n`` The problem is that in an authoritarian regime today , just like in the absolute monarchies of the medieval times , it is hard to distinguish between the personal goods of the sovereign and those of the state , '' said commentator Stefano Lepri in La Stampa newspaper . \nOther European countries have been more aggressive in their pursuit of assets linked to Gaddafi and his top aides . \nBritish publisher Pearson Plc last week said the LIA 's 3.2 percent stake in the company had been frozen because of the sanctions , while Austria has widened an asset freeze list to include a top official at the LIA . \nAlso making Italy 's position with Libya difficult is the prospect of a wave of illegal immigration , worse than the one that hit it in the early 1990s after the collapse of communism in Albania . \n`` The contrast between the moral imperative -LRB- to support democracy -RRB- and the political dividend is particularly stark because of the fear of the consequences the fall of Gaddafi 's regime could have on migration , '' said Emanuela Paoletti of the International Migration Institute at Oxford University . \nIn 2009 , Rome and Tripoli signed a deal allowing Italy 's coastguard to return boatloads of illegal immigrants to Libya Before then , Libya was a main staging post for illegal immigration from Africa and Gaddafi has made it clear that he could let the genie out of the bottle again if he wanted . \nHe told France 's Journal du Dimanche on Sunday that if he fell `` you will have immigration , thousands of people from Libya will invade Europe . \nThere will be no one to stop them any more .

'' \nMicroinsurance began as a form of charity in the 1990s , when the International Labor Organization began experimenting with super-cheap insurance policies , said Michael McCord , president of the U.S.-based MicroInsurance Center who recently discussed the topic with officials at Indonesia 's central bank . \nIn 1995 , McCord said he developed an entirely commercial microinsurance product backed by insurer AIG , with a view to selling it through a microfinance institute in Uganda . \n`` This example showed that commercial microinsurance is possible and became the demonstration model that helped other commercial insurers recognize the low-income market as viable , '' he said . \nWithin a decade , AIG 's Ugandan business covered about 1.6 million lives , and microinsurance premiums accounted for nearly 17 percent of its Ugandan unit 's profits . \nToday , a $ 1,000 life insurance policy sells for just $ 1 a year in Uganda , McCord said , making it affordable to the poor . \nHe estimates that about 135 million low-income people worldwide are now covered by cheap insurance , up from 78 million two years ago . \nInvestors are seeing potential in what could be a multi-billion dollar industry . \nThe Leapfrog Financial Inclusion Fund announced last week that it had raised $ 44 million for what it said was the world 's first microinsurance fund . \n`` The world desperately needs market-based solutions to poverty that draw in major financial investors by offering fair but competitive returns , '' said Dr. Andrew Kuper , President and Founder of LeapFrog , a Luxembourg-based fund . \n`` Microinsurance is both profitable and scalable , '' he was quoted as saying on the fund 's website . \nThe fund will invest in India , Pakistan , South Africa , Ghana and Kenya , it added . \nSome governments have taken a more active role in promoting such insurance schemes to the poor . \nFor example in India , it is compulsory for insurer firms to offer a microinsurance product , though the results have been mixed . \nIn practice , only about a third of India 's insurance firms offer such products , said Rupalee Ruchismita , founder of the Center for Insurance and Risk Management in India , which works with insurers and microfinance firms to develop livestock , health , weather , and catastrophe insurance plans . \n`` Most insurance firms are doing it simply to meet targets or to be in the good books of the regulators , and their argument is that it is very difficult to reach the intended audience , '' she said . \nInsurance experts , including Ruchismita and McCord , said such microinsurance schemes tend to be more successful when a community-based organization works in partnership with a private insurer , as both have strengths in different areas . \nFor insurers , the sheer number of potential customers in the low-income bracket makes this an attractive market . \n`` About 80 percent of the world population live in emerging markets but they account for only 22 percent of global GDP and 9 percent of global premiums , '' said Kua Ka Hin , Munich Re 's chief executive for Singapore and Southeast Asia . \n`` These emerging markets still offer huge potential ; they have got the large numbers which underline the principle of insurance . '' \nKua says Munich Re is looking at microinsurance products in Asia covering earthquakes , typhoons and even loss of income for businesses forced to close because of a flu , or H1N1 , pandemic . \nLast month , Munich Re began a trial of the world 's first flood microinsurance policy in flood-prone central Jakarta . \nResidents in Manggarai district pay 50,000 rupiah -LRB- $ 4.88 -RRB- for a flood `` cash card '' that can be cashed in for 250,000 rupiah if floodwater levels rise to or above 9.5 meters at the Manggarai Water Gate , which is 2 meters above normal levels . \nSo far only 50 policies have been sold , partly because the insurance only covers the very worst floods , not the recurrent knee-high flooding that can still ruin homes and possessions . \n`` People say 950 cm is too high and it 's unlikely to happen . \nAlso , the payout , they said , is too small , '' said Francis Purwanta , a spokesman for Munich Re 's local partner , Asuransi Wahana Tata , which sells the policies , pays out claims , and is then reimbursed by Munich Re . \n`` So we try to explain that it has happened before , at least three times in five years , '' said Purwanta . \nThe idea of making a profit off the very poorest members of society is also controversial . \nYet supporters say it is necessary if insurance companies are to back such policies . \n`` Companies can and should make profits of the low-income market . \nThis is the only way we will get commercial insurers in the market , '' said McCord , who adds that non-profit organizations working alone rarely have the technical expertise to calculate the risks and then design an effective insurance program . \n`` A commercial approach is what 's needed here , across the board . \nBut what helps a lot is using institutions that people trust to deliver the product . '' \nHowever , some critics , such as Wardah Hafidz , from the Indonesian non-government organization Urban Poor Consortium , suggest that governments are evading their responsibilities by expecting poor people to take out private insurance policies . \n`` The government should be giving protection from disasters to these people instead of assisting private business to target poor people to sell them their products , '' she said . \nThe argument is less philosophical for flood victims such as Bin Juri who knows what it 's like to see his precious possessions washed away and is well aware that the 250,000 rupiah insurance policy he holds would be inadequate to cover his losses if another flood struck his home . \n`` That alone cost 90,000 rupiah , '' he said , pointing to a large cooking pot at his feet . \n`` But it 's some money at least .

'' \nAnyone who has spent time in America will recognize the accuracy of that . \nMeyer is wisely unsentimental , too , about the so-called `` special relationship '' . \nThe phrase was banned from use while he was ambassador , quite rightly , and he smartly observes that the only countries that can truly lay claim to such a status in Washington - in the sense of being able to have significant influence on US politics and policy - are Ireland , Israel , Saudi Arabia and Taiwan , and certainly not Britain , even under Blair or Thatcher . \nMy dissatisfaction with Meyer 's book is not that he has written it . \nIt is that his indiscretion is selective and even calculated . \nAs the now celebrated extracts showed , Meyer has little compunction about putting the stiletto into politicians - and into Cherie Blair , who did the Meyers many kindnesses in her time , for which she is meanly rewarded here . \nMeyer is also more generous to Gordon Brown in these pages - I wonder why that could be ? \n- than he was in private , when he regularly complained about the chancellor 's repeated and childish snubs . \nHe is also protective towards fellow diplomats , officials and mandarins . \nMeyer 's relationship with the former diplomat Jonathan Powell , Blair 's chief-of-staff , was pivotal to his Washington years . \nSo were his connections to John Sawers and Matthew Rycroft , both of them senior ex-Washington embassy figures who worked for Blair in vital periods . \nCrucial players all , yet they move as silently through Meyer 's account as Inspector Bucket does through much of Bleak House Then there is the Catherine question . \nChristopher Meyer was an ambassadorial moderniser - nice , approachable , sociable and very comfortable with the media . \nHe and Catherine were high-profile Washingtonians , and there was much talk towards the end of his term that they would decamp to New York on his retirement to become a Manhattan power couple to rival Harry and Tina themselves . \nIt sometimes seemed to me that they risked overstepping the mark in this networking , and Meyer 's account of Catherine 's eurosceptic conversations with Rupert Murdoch and Richard Perle rather confirms that . \nRunning through this book there is not just a mandarin 's frustration with ministers but a radical Conservative 's disdain towards Labor , even though I firmly believe that Meyer mostly did an exceptional job on Blair 's behalf . \nIn the end , though , it all comes inescapably back to Iraq . \nIraq is inevitably both the pivotal subject in Meyer 's account and the one on which he allows himself the most sustained exposition of his own views . \nMeyer makes a powerful case for the view that Britain could have caused the Bush administration to delay the invasion until late 2003 , giving time to bring France and Russia onside for a second UN resolution , perhaps even forcing Saddam to quit , but certainly enabling proper attention to be given to a UN-centred plan for the post-Saddam Iraq . \nWould it have worked ? \nWho can now say ? \nBut Meyer and many others of us have every right to be extremely angry that it was never given a chance . \nMartin Kettle was the Guardian 's Washington bureau chief from 1997 to 2001 . \nTo order a copy of DC Confidential for # 18 with free UK p & p call Guardian book service on 08708360875 Write your review of this or any other book , find out what other readers thought or add it to your lists Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Review : DC Confidential by Christopher Meyer This article appeared on p10 of the Guardian review section of the Guardian on 01.19 GMT on Saturday 19 November 2005 Latest news and views from the Guardian 's books team paullaity : Read this : clever and funny and rightly cutting .

Fabrice Massiere concluded that `` the number of visitors has been off sharply because the number of visitors has declined `` In an interview with The Washington Post , Beaufranqui described himself as a `` happy retiree .

'' \nClinging together in the water for two hours , they drifted about a mile before they were rescued by the Crystal Clear , a supply vessel that rushed over from a rig about 25 miles away . \nThe blaze was extinguished in the late afternoon . \nIt did not appear that the fire triggered a crude oil leak like the one that occurred after the April 20 blowout of BP 's Macondo well . \nThat blowout , about 200 miles east of the Mariner platform , caused the worst oil spill in U.S. history and has forced BP to set aside billions to clean up the environmental damage and compensate gulf businesses and residents . \nA Coast Guard official initially said that Mariner Energy , which has a history of fires and safety violations , reported an oil sheen 100 feet wide and a mile long . \nBut Patrick Cassidy , director of investor relations for the company , later said that automated equipment on the platform had shut down its seven producing wells and that `` in an initial flyover of the facility , no oil sheen was seen on the water . '' \nOver the past week , the platform , in the Vermilion block 380 , had been producing 1,400 barrels a day of crude oil and 9.2 million cubic feet a day of natural gas . \nNonetheless , with the Gulf Coast still reeling from the massive BP spill , the fire brought new calls for tougher regulation just as the oil industry and the White House were hoping that public concerns would abate . \nHouse Energy and Commerce Chairman Henry A. Waxman -LRB- Calif. -RRB- and two other top Democrats on the committee sent a letter to Mariner Energy chief executive Scott D. Josey demanding a briefing by Sept. 10 . \nRep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- \nissued a statement saying the incident shows `` that much is left to be done to keep America 's workers and waters safe from those risks . '' \nThe Mariner Energy fire also occurred as the oil industry has been battling to stop tougher regulations in the wake of the BP accident . \nThe American Petroleum Institute is planning to hold rallies nationwide next week to urge the Obama administration to lift its moratorium on deep-water drilling and to pressure Congress to back away from new tax and liability measures . \nOil industry executives stressed the differences between the new incident and the BP blowout , but the differences also underline the magnitude of regulating the industry . \nThe blowout that sank the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig on April 20 occurred at the bottom of an exploration well in water a mile deep . \nThursday 's fire began on top of a production platform in about 320 feet of water . \nThere are just under three dozen deep-water exploration rigs in the Gulf of Mexico but thousands of shallow-water production wells . \nThe timing of the fire overshadowed positive developments on Thursday related to the BP spill . \nThe National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration reopened 5,130 square miles of fisheries . \nNOAA administrator Jane Lubchenco said it was `` another signal to tourists that the northern gulf is open for business . '' \nSeparately , BP removed the capping stack on the Macondo well , a prerequisite for retrieving the blowout preventer that failed . \nLike the BP well , the Mariner Energy platform was staffed almost exclusively by workers from oil service firms . \nMariner 's Cassidy said that only one of the 13 was a Mariner employee . \nUnlike BP , Mariner is a relatively small , independent oil and gas company . \nOnce part of Enron , it was caught up in the financial scandal that sent Enron into bankruptcy in 2001 . \nA group of private equity firms led by Acon , a firm with offices in Washington , bought Mariner in March 2004 and took it public later . \nThe company has been exploring in the gulf since 1996 , and at the end of 2009 had interests in nearly 350 federal offshore leases , with more than 110 of those in development . \nThe company has participated in more than 35 deep-water projects . \nIt effectively doubled the size of its operations in 2006 , when it acquired Forest Oil , including the Vermilion field . \nIn April , Apache Energy agreed to acquire Mariner , whose shares then more than doubled . \nThe acquisition has not been completed . \nOn Thursday , Mariner shares fell 60 cents , or 2.57 percent , to $ 22.75 a share on a day when the broader stock market rose . \nAccording to Bloomberg News , the largest shareholder is John Paulson , a hedge fund manager known for shorting subprime mortgage derivatives through Goldman Sachs before the housing market collapse . \nHe owned 9.7 percent of the firm at the end of June . \nIn its 2008 annual report , Mariner said that the Vermilion 380 field was its largest in the gulf 's Outer Continental Shelf . \nThe platform was damaged by Hurricane Ike in 2008 and production was shut down for most of 2009 . \nThursday 's fire is a new setback . \n`` We saw the fire from 20 miles away , smoke from it , '' said Dan Shaw , captain of the Crystal Clear supply boat that rescued the platform workers . \nAs they got closer , the boat 's four-man crew saw a Coast Guard helicopter hovering over the 13 workers , a few of whom waved . \nShaw said that 12 were wearing survival suits . \nThey stayed in a pack and helped the one man without a suit . \nShaw said his boat pulled alongside the group , in three-foot swells -LRB- `` a little bit lumpy , '' he said -RRB- , and a crewman hauled the 13 aboard one by one . \nThey were dropped off at another rig about seven miles away , where they were picked up by helicopters for the trip to land . \n`` They were pretty calm . \nThey were pretty tired , though . \nThey 'd been treading water for a couple hours , '' Shaw said , speaking by satellite phone from the boat . \nNews , features , and opinions on environmental policy , the science of climate change , and tools to live a green life .

Edward Markey , D-Mass . \nExperts say the massive Gulf spill has exposed a failure by the industry and the federal government to commit adequate resources to oil cleanup and response technology . \n`` Why they did n't start working on it after the -LRB- Ixtoc 1 -RRB- Mexican spill in 1979 is beyond me , '' said Gerald Graham , president of Worldocean Consulting , an oil spill prevention and response planning firm in British Columbia . \n`` Now they 're trying to catch up . '' \nOnly a fraction of the estimated 69 million to 131.5 million gallons of oil that have spewed into the Gulf have been recovered . \nAbout 10 million gallons of oil have been burned off , and 25 million gallons of oil-water mix have been mopped up . \nThe mainstays of the two-month-long cleanup effort are oil booms , mechanical skimmers and oil dispersants -- the same tools used to fight the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaska . \nImprovements to these methods have been incremental and few new ones have been developed , critics say , because oil companies have no financial incentive . \n`` The technology rapidly advanced for drilling , because there was money to be made , '' said Tim Robertson , general manager of Nuka Research & Planning , which specializes in oil spill response planning , and who worked on Seldovia , Alaska 's response during the Exxon spill . \n`` There was nothing similar that applies to oil spill recovery . '' \nFive companies -- Shell Oil , ExxonMobil , ConocoPhillips , Chevron Corp. , BP America -- together spent about $ 33.8 billion to explore for new oil and gas in the past three years , according to answers the companies provided this month to a House Energy & Commerce subcommittee . \nBut their spending on research for safety , accident prevention and spill response is `` paltry '' by comparison , said Rep. Edward Markey -LRB- D-Mass -RRB- , who chairs the subcommittee and introduced a bill Friday that would redirect $ 50 million per year in oil and gas royalty payments for research into new spill response technology . \nIn answers to Congress , most of the companies said they could not segregate costs for the safety - and spill-related research . \nFor example , ConocoPhillips said it spent $ 1.3 million over three years on research on safer drilling technologies , but did not specify how much it spends on accident prevention and spill-related research . \nExxonMobil said it spends $ 50 million a year on oil spill response , drilling and deepwater development research activities . \nThe company says it has maintained an internal spill research program for 40 years . \nBP said the company spent $ 29 million over three years on safer drilling operations research . \nBut spokesman Robert Wine said BP does not research oil spill cleanup technology . \nInstead , he said BP supports oil spill response organizations , such as the nonprofit Marine Spill Response Corp. . \nMSRC 's overall spending was $ 88 million in 2008 , the most recent year for which its IRS filing was available . \nBut it has no budget for research , MSRC spokeswoman Judith Roos told USA Today . \nRoos did not respond to calls and e-mails from The Associated Press . \nThe oil and gas industry now is taking steps to explore new technology . \nAnd BP has pledged $ 500 million for research efforts . \nFor its part , the federal government has spent relatively little to advance cleanup technology for spills . \nCongress appropriated only about one-sixth of the $ 30 million in research grants to universities authorized under the Oil Pollution Act of 1990 after the Exxon Valdez , according to the Coastal Response Research Center . \nThe Bureau of Ocean Energy Management , Regulation and Enforcement -- which was known as the Minerals Management Service until this month -- collects $ 13 billion a year in oil drilling royalties . \nBut the agency has been spending between $ 6 million to $ 7 million a year since 1995 on oil spill research . \nAnd the Coast Guard 's annual oil spill research budget has steadily dropped from about $ 5.6 million in 1993 to about $ 500,000 for each of the past four years . \nU.S. Rep. Brian Baird -LRB- D-Wash . -RRB- \n, who recently held hearings on oil spill cleanup technologies , said there has n't been much federal spending for cleanup because the political pressure is to drill for more oil . \n`` Our priorities have been about how to extract more oil in greater volumes and for greater profits , and there have n't been corresponding priorities on how to do so safely and how to prepare if there is an accident , '' he said in an interview . \nBP also has scrambled to try different cleanup techniques since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers and creating one of the U.S. 's worst environmental disaster . \nThe company recently ordered 32 centrifuge devices made by a company co-founded by Hollywood actor Kevin Costner , who had invested about $ 24 million in the project . \nThe company says the largest of the devices can process about 210,000 gallons a day , separating gunk from water . \nDeployed on barges , the centrifuges are intended to help skimmers work more efficiently by letting them unload the oil and water mix and cleaning it at sea instead of returning to port each time the tank is full . \nAdvances in drilling technology have enabled a boom in exploration and drilling in deep waters , where lower temperatures and higher pressures require sophisticated equipment . \n`` We 've pushed the envelope more and more on offshore drilling in deep waters , '' said Nancy Kinner , co-director of the Coastal Response Research Center , a partnership between the University of New Hampshire and the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . \nYet , she said , not much is known about how to collect oil from deep sea spills or how chemical dispersants used to break up oil behave at such depths . \nOil spill experts say that despite some improvements in containment booms and skimmers , they 're still limited in what they can do . \nBooms generally work best in calm weather and waves , and need lots of maintenance . \nIn Barataria Bay , absorbent boom placed around numerous marshy islands did n't stop oil slicks from reaching wetlands . \nSome sections of boom were torn apart or doubled over . \nThe stems of marsh grasses and other vegetation near the edge were stained dark brown with oil . \n`` In many case , all we have is that very basic technology and of course we use it , '' said Dennis Takahashi Kelso , vice president of the Ocean Conservancy and former Alaska Commissioner of Environmental Conservation during the Exxon Valdez spill .

Geithner and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke have appeared so many times during our country 's ongoing economic and financial storm . \nThe parallels between U.S. policymaking and what we see in emerging markets are clearest in how we 've mishandled the banking crisis . \nWe delude ourselves that our banks face liquidity problems , rather than deeper solvency problems , and we try to fix it all on the cheap just like any run-of-the-mill emerging market economy would try to do . \nAnd after years of lecturing Asian and Latin American leaders about the importance of consistency and transparency in sorting out financial crises , we fail on both counts : In March 2008 , one investment bank , Bear Stearns , is bailed out because it is thought to be too interconnected with the rest of the banking system to fail . \nHowever , six months later , another investment bank , Lehman Brothers -- for all intents and purposes indistinguishable from Bear Stearns in its financial market inter-connectedness -- is allowed to fail , with catastrophic effects on global financial markets . \nIn visits to Asian capitals during the region 's financial crisis in the late 1990s , I often heard Asian reformers such as Singapore 's Lee Kuan Yew or Japan 's Eisuke Sakakibara complain about how the incestuous relationship between governments and large Asian corporate conglomerates stymied real economic change . \nHow fortunate , I thought then , that the United States was not similarly plagued by crony capitalism ! \nHowever , watching Goldman Sachs 's seeming lock on high-level U.S. Treasury jobs as well as the way that Republicans and Democrats alike tiptoed around reforming Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae -- among the largest campaign contributors to Congress -- made me wonder if the differences between the United States and the Asian economies were only a matter of degree . \nOn Wall Street there is an old joke that the longest river in the emerging-market economies is `` de Nile . '' \nYet how often do U.S. leaders respond to growing signs of economic dysfunctionality by spouting nationalistic rhetoric that echoes the speeches of Latin American demagogues like Peru 's Alan Garcia in the 1980s and Argentina 's Carlos Menem in the 1990s ? \n-LRB- Even Garcia , currently in his second go-around as Peru 's president , seems to have grown up somewhat . -RRB- \nBut instead of facing our problems we extol the resilience of the U.S. economy , praise the most productive workers in the world , and go on and on about America 's inherent ability to extricate itself from any crisis . \nAnd we ignore our proclivity as a nation to spend , year in year out , more than we produce , to put off dealing with long-term problems , and to engage in grandiose long-term programs that as a nation we can ill afford . \nA singular characteristic of an emerging market heading for deep trouble is a seemingly suicidal tendency to become overly indebted to foreign creditors . \nThat tendency underlay the spectacular collapse of the Thai , Indonesian and Korean currencies in 1997 . \nIt also led Russia to default on its debt in 1998 and plunged Argentina into its economic depression in 2001 . \nYet we too seem to have little difficulty becoming increasingly indebted to the tune of a few hundred billion dollars a year . \nTo make matters worse , we do so to countries like China , Russia and an assortment of Middle Eastern oil producers -- none of which is particularly well disposed to us . \nLike Argentina in its worst moments , we never seem to question whether it is reasonable to expect foreigners to keep financing our extravagance , and we forget the bad things that happen to the Argentinas or Hungarys of the world when foreigners stop financing their excesses . \nSo instead of laying out a realistic plan for increasing our national savings , we choose not to face up to the Social Security and Medicare crises that lie ahead , embarking instead on massive spending programs that -- whatever their long-run merits might be -- we simply can not afford . \nAfter experiencing a few emerging-market crises , I get the sense of watching the same movie over and over . \nAll too often , a tragic part of that movie is the failure of the countries ' policymakers to hear the loud cries of canaries in the coal mine . \nBefore running up further outsized budget deficits , should we not heed the markets that now see a 10 percent probability that the U.S. government will default on its sovereign debt in the next five years ? \nAnd should we not be paying close attention to the Chinese central bank governor 's musings that he does not feel comfortable with the $ 1 trillion of U.S. government debt that the Chinese central bank already owns , let alone adding to those holdings ? \nIn the twilight of my career , when I am hopefully wiser than before , I have come to regret how the IMF and the U.S. Treasury all too often lectured leaders in emerging markets on how to `` get their house in order '' -- without the slightest thought that the United States might fare no better when facing a major economic crisis . \nNow , I fear time is running out for our own policymakers to mend their ways and offer real leadership to extricate the United States from its worst economic calamity since the 1930s . \nIf we insist on improvising and not facing our real problems , we might soon lose our status as a country to be emulated and join the ranks of those nations we have patronized for so long . \nDesmond Lachman , a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute , was previously chief emerging market strategist at Salomon Smith Barney and deputy director of the International Monetary Fund 's Policy and Review Department .

'' \nBrowner told CBS 's `` Face The Nation , '' \n`` This is probably the biggest environmental disaster we have ever faced in this country , '' top White House energy adviser Carol Browner told NBC 's `` Meet the Press . '' \nBP , its reputation and market value already battered by the catastrophic spill , and the entire U.S. oil industry face more probing questions about why safety backups did not accompany their pursuit of oil in ever deeper offshore waters . \n`` I think without question if the word criminal should be used in terms of an environmental crime against our country , that what 's going on in the Gulf of Mexico is going to qualify , '' U.S. Representative Ed Markey told CBS ' `` Face the Nation . '' \nDepartment of Justice officials are part of an ongoing federal investigation into the April 20 rig explosion that triggered the spill , and the Obama administration has not ruled out the possibility of a criminal prosecution . \nIn Louisiana , which has borne the brunt of the oil spill impact so far , local authorities demanded that BP and the federal government rush a plan to create a sand barrier to the oil by dredging and building up outlying sandbanks and islets . \n`` I 'm devastated ... We are dying a slow death , every time that oil takes out a piece of the marsh , a piece of Louisiana is gone forever , '' said Billy Nungesser , president of Plaquemines Parish , where the oil has clogged wetlands . \n`` Even the government seems powerless and all the experts . \nIf these people ca n't stop it , then who in the name of God can ? '' \nFather Gerry , a priest at St. Patrick Catholic Church in Port Sulphur , Louisiana , said , his voice heavy with emotion . \n` OIL COMING UP UNTIL AUGUST ' After giving up on Saturday an attempt to pump heavy fluids and blocking materials into the leaking well to `` kill '' it , BP is pursuing another option from its undersea toolbox . \nBut BP warns that the new procedure , which will try to fit a containment cap over the leaking well , could take between four and seven days . \nEven then success is not guaranteed because it has never been attempted before at the depth -- a mile down -- where the oil is leaking . \nBP Managing Director Robert Dudley told NBC 's `` Meet the Press '' the company would know by the end of the week whether the new containment effort worked . \nThe next BP step would involve undersea robots using diamond-rimmed saws to cut off a pipe over the well to put in place a containment device that would try to siphon off most of the leaking oil and gas up to a tanker ship on the surface . \nDudley said he did not think BP CEO Tony Hayward , who has faced heavy criticism , should be forced to resign . \nA surer solution to the leak , a relief well already being drilled , is not expected to be finished until early August . \nThis means crude oil continues to spew out daily , feeding a huge , fragmented slick that has already polluted marshlands teeming with wildlife and rich fisheries in Louisiana . \n`` There could be oil coming up until August . '' \nBrowner told CBS 's `` Face The Nation , '' `` We are prepared for the worst .

Bush , who was accused of complacency in handling it , and Obama is fighting to prevent the Gulf spill from becoming his own `` Katrina '' ahead of the November congressional elections . \nLouisianans still recovering from Katrina 's devastation were frustrated by the oil spill response . \n`` It 's been a screw-up from day one . \nNothing was at the ready and no one was in a position to respond , '' said Claude Marquette , a retired physician , 68 , speaking as he sat with his wife in his boat . \nBP 's Hayward had predicted that despite risks , the `` top kill '' had a 60 to 70 percent chance of success . \nHe said he did not know why it failed to stop the gusher . \nThe misstep is likely to drive his credibility lower , along with his company 's market value , which has dropped by 25 percent since the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded on April 20 , killing 11 workers , and triggering the spill . \nThe government estimated last week that 12,000 to 19,000 barrels -LRB- 504,000 to 798,000 gallons\\/1 .9 million to 3 million liters -RRB- a day are leaking from the well . \nAt that rate , the government now knows that the Gulf disaster has surpassed the 1989 Exxon Valdez spill in Alaskan waters . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \n-LRB- As I am trying to communicate to BP\\/the US to see if it is legitimate -RRB- : 1 . \nClear debris , rock , mud , etc from gushing pipe . \nStrong vice grips as wide as the pipe diameter squeeze the pipe shut as absolutely as much as possible . \nSolder and Meld the Pipe Shut , from one end of the crease to the other , and Reinforce the Closure . \nDo for all open pipes . \nUse it if it will work . \nI can not fathom why they have not just tried the procedure of getting tankers on the way and use the method they have mentioned to collect as much as possible . \nThat done sooner seems it would have sharply reduced the spill magnitude . \nA small-yield nuke would melt a couple hundred feet of basalt on top of that tiny hole and compress a large portion of the sea bed below that as well . \nIts just a hole in the ground . \nMelt it shut with a nuke . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "The Louisiana oil spill has become the biggest environmental disaster in the country's history, with crude oil continuing to spew out daily and feeding a huge, fragmented slick that has already polluted marshlands teeming with wildlife and rich fisheries in Louisiana.", "prop_score_1": 0.7, "generate_explanation_1": "In this rewrite, I have adopted a more formal and professional tone by using more sophisticated vocabulary and sentence structure.

5bn spent on farmers ' compensation . \nA year later , the scientists tried to maintain that BSE `` might '' spread to sheep because , according to one government scientist , `` the absence of evidence is not evidence of absence '' . \nThe meat industry was wrecked and an absurd ongoing cost was imposed on stock farmers with the closure and concentration of abattoirs . \nThis science-based insanity was repeated during the Sars outbreak of 2003 , asserted by Dr Patrick Dixon , formerly of the London Business School , to have `` a 25 % chance of killing tens of millions '' . \nThe press duly headlined a plague `` worse than Aids '' . \nNot one Briton died . \nThe same lunacy occurred in 2006 with avian flu , erupting after a scientist named John Oxford declared that `` it will be the first pandemic of the 21st century '' . \nThe WHO issued a statement that `` one in four Britons could die '' . \nEpidemiologists love the word `` could '' because it can always assure them of a headline . \nDuring the avian flu mania , Canada geese were treated like Goering 's bombers . \nRSPB workers were issued with protective headgear . \nThe media went berserk , with interviewers asking why the government did not close all schools `` to prevent up to 50,000 deaths '' . \nThe Today program 's John Humphrys became frantic when a dead goose flopped down on an isolated Scottish beach and a hapless local official refused to confirm the BBC 's hysteria . \nThe bird might pose no threat to Scotland , but how dare he deny London journalists a good panic ? \nMeanwhile a real pestilence , MRSA and C difficile , was taking hold in hospitals . \nIt was suppressed by the medical profession because it appeared that they themselves might be to blame . \nThese diseases have played a role in thousands of deaths in British hospitals - the former a reported 1,652 and the latter 8,324 in 2007 alone . \nLike deaths from alcoholism , we have come to regard hospital-induced infection as an accident of life , a hazard to which we have subconsciously adjusted . \nMRSA and C difficile are not like swine flu , an opportunity for public figures to scare and posture and spend money . \nThey are diseases for which the government is to blame . \nThey claim no headlines and no Cobra priority . \nTheir sufferers must crawl away and die in silence . \nA panic stoked in order to posture and spend This article appeared on p29 of the Main section section of the Guardian on 00.01 BST on Wednesday 29 April 2009 . \nTime for a ban .

'' \nHurricane season in the region ends on 30 November . \nEven though the evacuation turned out to be short-lived , it revealed one important fact : BP and the federal government are increasingly sure that the temporary plug that has mostly contained the oil for eight days will hold . \nThey did n't loosen the cap even when they thought they 'd lose sight of it during the evacuation , although in the end , at least some of the real-time cameras trained on the ruptured well apparently kept rolling . \nIronically , Bonnie may even have a positive effect . \nChurning waters could actually help dissipate oil in the water , spreading out the surface slick and breaking up tar balls , said Jane Lubchenco , leader of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration . \nBeaches may look cleaner in some areas as the storm surge pulls oil away , though other areas could see more oil washed ashore . \n`` I think the bottom line is , it 's better than it might have been , '' Lubchenco said . \nAt the site of the relief well , workers who spent Thursday and Friday pulling nearly a mile of segmented steel pipe out of the water and stacking the sections on deck will now have to reverse the process . \nIt is not likely the BP will be able to resume drilling until tomorrow . \nBy Wednesday , workers should finish installing steel casing to fortify the relief shaft , Allen said , and by Friday , crews plan to start blasting in heavy mud and cement through the mechanical cap , the first phase of a two-step process to seal the well for good . \nBP will then finish drilling the relief tunnel which could take up to a week to pump in more mud and cement from nearly two miles under the sea floor . \nMeanwhile , people in the oil-affected hamlet of Grand Isle , Louisiana , spent a gray Saturday at the beach , listening to music . \nThe Island Aid concert , which included LeAnn Rimes and Three Dog Night , raised money for civic projects on the island . \nFor the afternoon at least , things were almost back to normal . \nYoung women in bathing suits rode around on golf carts while young men in pickup trucks tooted their horns and shouted . \n`` This is the way Grand Isle is supposed to be but has n't been this year , '' said Anne Leblanc of Metairie , Louisiana , who said her family has been visiting the island for years . \n`` This is the first we came this year . \nWith the oil spill there has n't been a reason to come , no swimming , no fishing .

$ 50m on coronation President 's lavish inauguration is ` obscene ' when US troops are dying in Iraq war , say critics Sunday 9 January 2005 00.46 GMT It will be one of the biggest parties in American history , but half of the country will be left out . \nWith a price tag of up to $ 50 million , President George W Bush 's inauguration in 11 days ' time will be an unashamed celebration of Red America 's victory over Blue America in last November 's election . \nIt is going to be the most expensive , most security-obsessed event in the history of Washington DC . \nAn army of 10,000 police , secret service officers and FBI agents will patrol the capital for four days of massive celebrations that some critics have derided as reminiscent of the lavish shindigs thrown by Louis XIV , France 's extravagant Sun King . \nMore than 150,000 people , nearly all Republicans whose tickets are a reward for election work , will pack the Mall to hear Bush take his oath of office on 20 January . \nThere will be nine official balls , countless unofficial ones , parades and a concert hosted by Bush 's daughters , Jenna and Barbara . \nAmid the official pageantry will be many huge parties laid on by companies wishing to win favor with Washington 's power players . \nAnyone who is anyone in Republican circles will be in town . \nMany Democrats will be leaving . \nWith so many big names in one place , security measures will include road blocks , anti-aircraft guns guarding the skies and sniper teams patrolling the rooftops . \nMany observers say it is all too much . \n` We have elected a President who seems to have quite a monarchical role . \nIt is a bit of a coronation , ' said Larry Haas , a former official in Bill Clinton 's White House . \nCertainly , Bush 's inauguration will be an orgy of gladhanding and partying by the Republican faithful from all over the country . \nOne Washington hotel , the Mandarin Oriental , is offering visitors four nights in its Presidential Suite for $ 200,000 . \nThe price tag includes a 24-hour butler , a chauffeur-driven Rolls-Royce or Humvee , daily champagne and caviar and a flight to the hotel in a private jet . \nOne highlight of the bonanza is the Black Tie and Boots Ball organised by Bush 's home state of Texas , with the President as star guest . \nTen thousand tickets sold out in less than 50 minutes , and are now trading privately at $ 1,300 each . \nAnother is the Commander-in-Chief 's Ball where Bush will honor American soldiers fighting in Iraq and Afghanistan . \nThis is billed as the centrepiece of the inauguration , which itself has a theme tinged with the idea of military service . \nAll the partying is being condemned by many commentators as in poor taste for a nation fighting a bloody war . \nCarroll Wilson , editor of the Texas newspaper the Times Record , has called the cost obscene and ' a horrendous waste ' . \n` There 's something inherently embarrassing about spending $ 50m on a party that will start and end in the blink of a very red eye , ' he added . \nThe fighting in Iraq has provoked calls for the celebrations to be toned down , as they were during the two world wars when some were even canceled . \nBush 's second inauguration will be the first in wartime since President Richard Nixon took office in 1969 during the Vietnam conflict . \nYet the partying is being intensified . \nThe Commander-in-Chief 's Ball is being hailed by organisers as a fitting tribute to American soldiers on active service . \nMore than 2,000 troops and their partners , selected by the Pentagon , will take part . \nMost have served in Iraq or Afghanistan or are about to go there . \nThe parades will have a stronger than normal military theme . \nThat angers many anti-war protesters who say the lavish celebration is inappropriate during conflict . \nSome conservative commentators have even joined the fray , contrasting the spending with a recent scandal over a shortage of armor for American soldiers and their vehicles . \nA huge series of demonstrations is now being planned which organisers say will be much larger than the ones that marked Bush 's first inauguration after the contested Florida recount in 2000 . \n` We want our voices to be heard , ' said a spokesman for the Answer Coalition , which is co-ordinating the protests . \nThe huge security presence means there is likely to be little disruption , especially of the oath-taking ceremony itself . \nMore vulnerable may be the corporate events taking place all over the city . \nThe $ 50m bill is mostly being paid by private donations from people and firms currying political favor . \nWith a strict ban on large single donations to active political campaigns , the inauguration offers a rare chance for companies and individuals to lavish large sums of money on the President and his party simultaneously . \nThe big donors are split into ` underwriters ' , who stumped up $ 250,000 each , and ` sponsors ' , who merely shelled out $ 100,000 . \nBoth gain access to a variety of events that will be attended by Bush . \nThe donors are a familiar roster of Republican supporters and big business . \nThey include firms in the President 's former business , oil , such as Exxon Mobil and ChevronTexaco , former Enron president Richard Kinder and Texas oil baron Boone Pickens , who also gave $ 500,000 to the anti-John Kerry campaign of Swift Boat Veterans for Truth . \nThough the guests will be celebrating Bush 's victory , some Washington insiders will also be keeping a keen eye on the jockeying for position that has already begun for the next election . \n` The clock to 2008 starts ticking the second after Bush finishes his oath , ' Haas said ` At that moment Republicans begin moving into position for that . \nBush should enjoy his moment while he can .

'' \n`` We 've never represented anything different than that . \nThat 's why emphasis is always on preventing these things from occurring , because when they happen we are not very well equipped to deal with them , '' Tillerson said . \nLawmakers seemed unconvinced that the four major oil companies had better contingency plans than BP , which is still struggling to contain the oil that has been gushing into the ocean from a ruptured well for nearly two months . \nThe hearing could lead to new legislation that would have wide impact in the U.S. Gulf , America 's best hope for increasing its domestic oil supply . \nIt 's also one of the most promising exploration frontiers for companies including BP , Shell and Chevron . \nOne by one the lawmakers took turns heaping criticism on the oil executives who sat expressionless as they stared facing rows of their inquisitors . \n`` Lawmakers won , no question . \nAs soon as the companies were asked why they were better , it ended up making them all look worse in the eyes of the lawmakers , '' said Kevin Book , analyst at ClearView Energy Partners in Washington . \nThough all five men were seated at the same large table , it was clearly four against one with BP America 's chief Lamar McKay looking solitary at the end of the table as he faced most of the verbal attacks . \nWhile McKay silently listened to Republican Representative Cliff Stearns of Florida demand his resignation , the other executives had only to defend their policies and insist that they would have done it differently . \nMcKay , who appeared drawn but showed little emotion , did not offer much new ahead of Thursday 's testimony by BP 's chief executive , Tony Hayward , on Capitol Hill . \nThough Wall Street investors shrugged off the hearing as political theater , it is a tradition in Washington and a conduit of public anger , especially ahead of November elections . \nRepresentative Bart Stupak , a Democrat and one of the lawmakers heading a probe of the disaster , slammed the companies ' response plans for offshore accidents . \nHe singled out Exxon Mobil for having a 40-page media response strategy , including pre-written talking points . \n`` Exxon Mobil 's plan appears more concerned about public perception than wildlife protection given the fact that their media plan is fives times longer than its plan for protecting wildlife , '' said Stupak , adding that all of the companies ' plans were `` virtually worthless when an actual spill occurs . '' \nRepresentative Henry Waxman , a Democrat , said the companies had submitted nearly identical `` cookie cutter '' strategies to deal with a major spill which all included techniques that had failed to stem the flow of oil from BP 's well . \n`` We found that none of the five companies has an adequate plan , '' he said . \nBP 's McKay was emotionless when repeatedly asked by Markey to apologize for under-estimating how much oil was gushing into the ocean after the well ruptured . \n`` We are sorry for everything the Gulf Coast is going through , we are sorry for that and the spill , '' he said , adding that the company did not have the technology to measure the amount of spilled oil . \nBut though the four non-BP executives appeared to stick together , chatting apart from McKay when the hearing ended , they still had to face public anger . \nAs the hearing came to a close , a protester holding a soda bottle filled with a black liquid approached the executives shouting , `` You all are just as corrupt as BP . \nYou should all be ashamed of yourself . '' \nPolice presence was beefed up , with the building and hearing room entrances both inside and outside lined with police officers . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nWith all this scrutiny they know it is only a matter of time until someone actually looks at what they do and not what they say . \nWe will buy them , I promise you . \nAnd give large tax breaks to the companies that build their factories in the U. S ... . \nit will create jobs too . \nIf you want things to change -LRB- for the better -RRB- , look beyond this fiasco and start spreading the word every where you go and everywhere you type . \nSo typical of the Obama administration , summoning the heads of the oil companies to be attacked by strutting politicians trolling for votes back home come November . \nI 've seen this show before , first with the auto execs , then the big bank execs , now the oil company execs . \nThe ritual prostration before these know-nothing politicians is , frankly , appalling . \nWorse still is the fact that these oil executives are kicking BP while it 's down . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "The oil company executives appeared before Congress to defend their practices and distance themselves from BP's massive oil spill.", "prop_score_1": 0.5, "generate_explanation_1": "The executives from four major oil companies testified at a House Energy and Commerce hearing, hoping to head off potentially costly new regulations by detailing their drilling policies and criticizing BP for not following industry norms.

Bush in the days following hurricane Katrina . \nAnd today , the Obama White House said waivers might again be considered . \nIf there is the need for any type of waiver , that would obviously be granted , said White House Spokesman Robert Gibbs . \nBut , we 've not had that problem thus far . \nDemocratic Senator Bill Nelson is not so sure about that . \nHe s hearing from the folks back home in Florida , where they want all the skimmer ships they can get . \nHe sent a letter to Admiral Thad Allen today which read in part : Admiral , I believe the orange mousse of oil that is now in Florida s waters is more than enough evidence that we need to take advantage of every appropriate global resource . \nPlease advise as to whether we are taking full advantage of the offers of assistance from other countries . \nWhen asked about this by Fox News , Admiral Allen said , If it gets to the point where a Jones Act waiver is required , we 're willing to do that too Nobody has come to me with a request for a Jones Act waiver . \nAfter 50 plus days of oil flowing freely into the gulf , the question could be asked : Why do effective and proven foreign clean up ships remain on the sidelines ? \nCarafano believes it may have something to do with the Obama administration s close relationship with labor unions . \nCause this is a big thing for unions , Carafano said . \nThe unions see it as protecting jobs . \nThey hate when the Jones Act gets waived , and they pound on politicians when they do that . \nSo are we giving in to unions and not doing everything we can , or is there some kind of impediment that we do n't know about ? \nIf the Obama Administration needs an example of what can happen when global assets are allowed to tackle a massive oil spill , they need look no further than Saudi Aramco s clean up of a massive wartime spill off the Kuwaiti coast in 1991 . \nAramco summoned every available ship to assist in the cleanup . \nThe company claims it recovered 900,000 barrels of oil in roughly three months . \nThe industry views that effort as the gold standard in oil spill cleanups . \nFOX News covers the action from all the angles . \nGet constant updates from our in-the-field reporters and producers and read stories you 'll only see here .

'' \nWith work progressing on the final phase of the `` static kill '' sealing of the well , Thad Allen , the Obama administration 's top official on the spill , told reporters there would be no new oil in the Gulf . \nBut those assurances failed to satisfy scientists and environmental groups , who disputed the claim by Carol Browner , the White House energy and climate adviser , that `` the vast majority of oil is gone '' . \nIn Louisiana , state wildlife officials told CNN that tar balls and patches of oil were still washing up in the marshes and coastal areas of St Bernard , Plaquemines and Jefferson parishes . \nSusan Shaw , a marine toxicologist and director of the Marine Environmental Research Institute , said the White House had been too quick to declare the oil was gone . \n`` The blanket statement that the public understood is that most of the oil has disappeared . \nThat is not true . \nAbout 50 % of it is still in the water , '' she said . \nLike other scientists , she said the report failed to explain how it reached its estimates on the amount of oil that was biodegraded naturally , or dispersed with chemicals . \n`` There are a lot of unanswered questions . '' \nEven the White House 's own estimates still left a spill five times the size of that from the Exxon Valdez , she said , with long-term consequences that would be unknown for years to come . \nTerry Hazen , the head of ecology at the Lawrence Berkeley national laboratory , who studied the spill for Noaa , said his teams could find no trace of oil on the surface or in the deep between 2km and 100km from the well site last week . \n`` Whatever was put into the environment , it is undetectable in the water column and the surface of water , '' he said . \nBut he added : `` That is not true though in the marshes or on some of the shorelines . \nWe do know there is still oil out there . '' \nHe also said there were potential weaknesses in the analysis because of Noaa 's assumptions about the size of the spill . \n`` When they do all of the inventories trying to estimate all of the oil and where it went there is pretty wide margins of estimates of how much was actually coming out of the well head , '' he said . \n`` That complicates everything . '' \nHowever , such nuances were overshadowed by the White House , which staged a high-profile event on Wednesday to announce that the well had stopped flowing , and that the consequences of the spill were not as catastrophic as once feared . \nFrancesca Griffo , senior scientist at the Union of Concerned Scientists , said the White House had stepped on more nuanced statements from Noaa scientists . \n`` When these reports go through the spin machine they get distorted , '' she said . \n`` If you look closely at this report , it makes it very clear that this is not over .

'' \nI was allowed into one of the containment labs which will be used to make the vaccine but not where the live virus is being used . \nThis is not because of infection but because I might contaminate the vaccine production process . \nIt involves scientists painstakingly injecting a small amount of virus into each egg which will then be incubated over the weekend . \nBy Monday , they should have enough virus to begin the next stage . \nTwo different techniques are being used . \nFirst , `` reverse genetics '' , where scientists take the H and the N surface proteins from the H1N1 virus and mix them with a laboratory virus known as PR8 . \nThis creates a harmless hybrid virus which can be used for the vaccine . \nThe second technique involves injecting both the H1N1 and PR8 viruses into eggs and allowing the hybrid strain to be created through a natural re-assortment of their genes . \nThe vaccine will work by tricking the immune system into thinking it has been infected with the H1N1 swine flu virus so that it creates antibodies against it . \nThen , if subsequently exposed to the virus , the immune system will destroy the invader before it can cause illness . \nThe first seed strain of H1N1 swine flu vaccine should be ready in three to four weeks . \nIt will then take another four or five months for vaccine manufacturers to produce the vaccine in bulk . \nOn Wednesday , when the WHO raised the threat level to five - one short of a pandemic , its director general stopped short of asking vaccine manufacturers to switch to an H1N1 strain . \nDr Margaret Chan said this was because it was not yet clear how severe the virus would be . \n`` It will be an extremely difficult decision for the World Health Organisation and governments to make , '' said Dr Wood . \n`` Manufacturers are halfway through producing their normal vaccine to combat winter flu . \nIt could take manufacturers up to five months to mass-produce the vaccine `` If they are asked to stop doing that it means there will be shortages of the normal seasonal vaccine and vulnerable people could be susceptible if there was an epidemic of ordinary flu this winter '' . \nThe WHO has a matter of weeks in which to make that decision if it does not want to lose valuable time . \nNo-one should expect a swine flu vaccine to be available before the Autumn . \nIn fact most of us will have to wait a lot longer . \nAround 300 million doses of seasonal flu vaccine are produced globally each year . \nThe vaccine includes three different strains of human flu so each dose takes three eggs to produce . \nIf manufacturers switched to producing a single pandemic strain vaccine , they might feasibly triple the number of doses to around 900 million . \nBut it may not be that simple . \nWe do not know how well the virus will grow in eggs or how much antigen will be needed to create an effective vaccine . \nIt may require two injections to provide adequate immunity . \nWith a world population of more than six billion , there clearly will not be enough to go round and the disease will hit poorer countries hardest because they can not afford to buy the vaccines . \nThe UK government has contracts with two manufacturers to produce 120 million doses of pandemic vaccine - enough for two doses per Briton , if required . \nBut unless you are a front-line healthcare worker or someone involved in an essential service , do not be surprised if you are not among the first to receive it . \nIf a pandemic is declared and vaccine production begun then most of us are likely to have to wait until well into next year before we are offered it . \nThat is why it is so important to try to prevent an epidemic in Britain now . \nThat would buy us valuable time in which to create a vaccine .

Henry Waxman , D-Calif . \n, asserted that their companies ' spill response plans amounted to `` paper exercises '' that mirrored BP 's failed plan . \nTheir strategies to plug a spill deep beneath the sea are the same failed strategies that have stymied BP , Waxman said . \nThe other companies `` are no better prepared to deal with a major oil spill than was BP , '' said Waxman , setting the tone for a tense hearing . \nBut oil company executives were quick to distance themselves from BP . \nChevron chief executive John Watson said Chevron 's deep-water drilling activities `` are safe and environmentally sound , '' but he said the company welcomes any new standards and `` we must learn from this accident .

'' \nSpeaking to reporters after an Oval Office meeting with visiting British Prime Minister Gordon Brown , Obama said he has no doubt that his plan to rescue the U.S. economy will work . \nAmong the topics he discussed with Brown , he said , were efforts to coordinate economic stimulus plans with other members of the Group of 20 , an organization of major world economies that is holding a summit meeting in London next month . \nOn the domestic front , `` I 'm absolutely confident that credit 's going to be flowing again , that businesses are going to start seeing opportunities for investment , they 're going to start hiring again , people are going to be put back to work , '' Obama said in response to a question . \n`` What I 'm looking at is not the day-to-day gyrations of the stock market , but the long-term ability for the United States and the entire world economy to regain its footing . \nAnd , you know , the stock market is sort of like a tracking poll in politics . \nYou know , it bobs up and down day to day . \nAnd if you spend all your time worrying about that , then you 're probably going to get the long-term strategy wrong . '' \nThe U.S. banking system `` has been dealt a heavy blow , '' and a lot of losses `` are working their way through the system , '' Obama said , adding that `` it 's not surprising that the market is hurting as a consequence . '' \nHe continued , `` On the other hand , what you 're now seeing is profit and earning ratios are starting to get to the point where buying stocks is a potentially good deal if you 've got a long-term perspective on it . \nI think that consumer confidence , as they see the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act taking root -- businesses are starting to see opportunities for investment and potential hiring . \nWe are going to start creating jobs again . '' \n`` It 's going to take a long time to get this economy back on track , '' Obama said . \nHe urged Americans `` to just recognize that we dug a very deep hole for ourselves . \nThere were a lot of bad decisions that were made . \nWe are cleaning up that mess . \nIt 's going to be sort of full of fits and starts , in terms of getting the mess cleaned up ; but it 's going to get cleaned up . '' \n`` And we are going to recover , '' Obama said . \n`` And we are going to emerge more prosperous , more unified and , I think , more protected from systemic risk , having learned these lessons , than we were before . '' \nPressed later at a White House news briefing on whether Obama had essentially issued a `` buy call '' to help boost the stock market , spokesman Robert Gibbs dismissed the notion . \nObama has often `` talked about the fact that brighter days for our economy are ahead , if we take important steps and make important decisions now , about addressing many of the problems and challenges that we face . '' \nHe said Obama has also said `` that it 's not his job to comment on or react to what the market does , up and down , on any given day , but instead to look at the longer term , at the longer horizon , at what can be done in this country to meet those challenges . '' \nOn Capitol Hill , meanwhile , Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke said the government needs to continue moving aggressively to combat the recession and financial crisis , even as it takes steps to rein in the budget deficit in the longer term . \nTestifying before the Senate Budget Committee , Bernanke said more money might be needed to stabilize the financial system . \n`` Although progress has been made on the financial front since last fall , more needs to be done , '' Bernanke said . \n`` Whether further funds will be needed depends on the results of the current supervisory assessment of banks , the evolution of the economy and other factors . \nThe administration has included a placeholder in its budget for more funding for financial stabilization , should it be necessary . '' \nWith that and fiscal stimulus spending , the government debt will likely approach 60 percent of gross domestic product , up from 40 percent before the financial crisis and the highest since the years after World War II . \nBernanke said that debt ratio makes it all the more important to contain deficits in the future to maintain credibility among the investors worldwide who buy U.S. government debt . \nBut he gave a strong endorsement to continued -- and expensive -- efforts to deal with the crisis in the near term . \n`` We are better off moving aggressively today to solve our economic problems , '' Bernanke said . \n`` The alternative could be a prolonged episode of economic stagnation that would not only contribute to further deterioration in the fiscal situation , but would also imply lower output , employment and incomes for an extended period . '' \nBut , he added , `` maintaining the confidence of the financial markets requires that we begin planning now for the restoration of fiscal balance . '' \nHe said the government will need to withdraw the temporary parts of the fiscal stimulus as the economy recovers , and spending on stabilizing the financial system must `` wind down . '' \nBernanke , as is his practice , neither endorsed nor opposed many specific spending recommendations contained in the proposed budget released by the Obama administration last week . \nOn such issues as energy , health care , education and tax policy , he said only that they are `` complex policy issues in which the specific design of each program is as important as the budgetary amount allocated to it '' and that Congress `` will have considerable work in evaluating how to proceed .

'' \nBut when he does he becomes more closely associated with the ugly problem and more responsible for the nearly impossible task of stopping the flow and managing a cleanup that will leave most people unsatisfied . \nThe governors of the affected states have to be busy and make demands of BP and the feds , yet they must not appear to be ineffective when not much happens . \nIn Washington , among those with no real responsibility , there is a contest to see who can kick BP the hardest and promise the most restitution to all those affected by the spill . \nUltimately , there will not be enough money to make everybody happy , much less quiet . \nSo we are entering a political cycle of blame , promises and poor results , which leads to more blame and another layer of promises . \nAll the while , the results of the spill get worse , and the pictures of the failure appear on every TV in America several times a day . \nUsing contrived criminal and civil tools , Obama may decide that the death of BP is his best political cover ; governors will do what real work can be done and hope for the best ; Congress will no doubt commission a study , release a report and pass new laws whose effects , intended and unintended , are hard to imagine . \nThis is a great American tragedy whose political consequences will linger for years . \nNo one will emerge as a hero , savior or indispensable leader . \nInstead , the revelation of the limits of our technology , leaders , laws and energy options will leave us all frustrated and in a mood to blame everybody involved . \nUntil now President Obama has avoided serious political damage from the government 's handling of the spill , but this may be changing . \nRecent polling finds pluralities or majorities of the public disapproving of the administration 's response or giving it low marks for its handling of the situation . \nEven among Democrats , ratings of the administration 's performance have been tepid . \nThe spill is unfolding at a time of exceptionally low levels of trust in government , which may make the public even less forgiving . \nStill , unlike Hurricane Katrina , where the government had primary responsibility for dealing with the crisis , until now its role has been secondary to that of BP . \nAnd the public has been far more critical of BP for its handling of the crisis . \nAlthough the spill may cause Obama political damage in the short run , it could help him in the longer run with key legislative priorities for his administration : the passage of a comprehensive energy bill and efforts to address environmental protection more generally . \nThe spill has spurred an increase in support for environmental protection , which had declined over the past two years as concerns about the economy pushed aside many other public priorities . \nWhile polling by Pew Research and other organizations continues to find at least plurality support for offshore oil drilling , the level of support is much lower than before the spill . \nWith President Obama 's approval rating dropping to close to 45 percent , driven in large part by his handling of the worst oil spill in U.S. history , the Obama presidency is facing a real crisis . \nAnd while it was certainly welcome news Thursday that the president took full responsibility for the situation , that will do little to stem the ever-increasing political fallout from both sides of the aisle -- from James Carville to Sarah Palin . \nThe president has to stop seeking to both blame and distance himself from BP , all the while asserting federal authority and responsibility . \nHe needs a fundamentally different approach . \nHe has to make it clear that we are all in this together -- not as corporations or populists , not as Democrats or Republicans , but as Americans working to solve the problem collectively . \nThis would be similar to how , in his National Defense Review , Obama spoke of the need for developing and enhancing alliances around the world to confront common enemies and solve common problems . \nHe must emphasize results and outcomes -- not partisanship , populist bashing , or divide and conquer . \nThis is how he ran his campaign , how he said he would govern and how he has to govern now . \nIf he does n't rally Americans , no amount of rhetorical parsing or political gamesmanship will solve a problem that has the potential to undermine the credibility and perceived competence of the Obama presidency . \nAuthor and political commentator ; manager of Al Gore 's 2000 presidential campaign ; served on the Louisiana Recovery Authority from 2005 to 2008 Even if some good comes out of BP 's oil flood , it still looks like a lose-lose situation for everyone involved . \nNot only has the spill caused a substantial loss of marshland for the gulf and the livelihoods of residents , it will have lasting effects far into the future . \nBoth Louisiana Gov.

'' \nBut , Ibrahim said , the country 's longtime ruler would not step down from power as a prerequisite for further dialogue concerning the prospective cease-fire . \nZuma had `` lengthy discussions '' with Gadhafi , his office said in a news release . \n`` We call on all leaders in Libya to exercise decisive leadership to find a solution to the crisis in the country , and to put the interests of their country first , '' Zuma said in the release . \nHe also urged `` NATO and other parties to respect the -LRB- African Union 's -RRB- role in searching for a solution . '' \nAn intensified NATO campaign has resulted in sizable defections from the Gadhafi camp , including eight generals who recently fled to Italy , the U.N. Under-Secretary-General B. Lynn Pascoe said in a written statement . \nIn recent weeks , Gadhafi has been seen in public only rarely as NATO has stepped up attacks against his sprawling Bab el-Azizia compound . \nRasmussen said Monday that Gadhafi 's `` reign of terror is coming to an end . '' \n`` He is increasingly isolated at home and abroad , '' Rasmussen said in a speech in Bulgaria . \n`` Even those closest to him are departing , defecting or deserting . '' \nRasmussen said NATO has made `` significant progress '' in its Libya operation after conducting more than 3,300 strike sorties since March . \nOpposition forces have also gained ground in the port city of Misrata , pushing westward toward the Libyan capital , the statement said . \nGovernment forces have regrouped in positions along the country 's western Nafusa mountains , especially near the city of Yefran , where some 54,000 Libyans have fled to neighboring Tunisia , Pascoe said . \nClose to 900,000 people have fled Libya since the recent conflict began back in February , the United Nations says . \nGhanem has been in charge of an industry battered by the civil conflict raging across the country . \nAccording to Ghanem 's curriculum vitae on the website of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries , he is married with three daughters and one son . \nHe received a bachelor 's degree in economics at the University of Libya in Benghazi and earned advanced degrees in the United States , at Tufts University 's Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy in Boston . \nGhanem has master 's degrees in both economics and law and diplomacy and a doctorate in international economics , the website says . \nHe 's held various positions in the Libya 's government , including several spots in the Oil Ministry , and has been director of the OPEC secretariat 's research division . \nHe has written many articles and books on energy , it says . \nHe was secretary of the General People 's Committee from June 2003 to March 2006 , a position that 's equivalent to prime minister . \nGhanem has been chairman of the Management Committee of the National Oil Corporation from April 2006 to the present . \nCNN 's Hada Messia , Raja Razek and Richard Roth contributed to this report .

'' \nOfficials cautioned that a `` no-fly '' zone over Libya , an idea popular among Democratic and Republican lawmakers , would be difficult to enforce and might not stop helicopter gunships from attacking rebels fighting to end Muammar Gaddafi 's four-decade rule . \nThe Obama administration has faced sharp criticism , especially from Republicans and conservative commentators , for being too cautious over the turmoil in Libya but has signaled it will not be rushed into hasty decisions that could suck the U.S. military into a new war and fuel anti-American sentiment . \nOne major obstacle : U.S. officials are still trying to identify the main actors within the opposition fighting to oust Gaddafi . \nThe aims of these groups are unclear and it is not even certain they view the United States favorably . \nCarney said the United States was trying to `` reach out '' to Gaddafi opponents through diplomats , business people and non-governmental groups . \nHe also had a fresh warning to Gaddafi 's close associates , saying U.S. intelligence agencies were seeking to identify those involved in the violence which has forced tens of thousands of people to flee the country . \nPresident Barack Obama said he wanted to `` send a very clear message to the Libyan people that we will stand with them in the face of unwarranted violence and the continuing suppression of democratic ideals that we 've seen there . '' \nBut Kori Schake , an associate professor at West Point military academy , was critical of Obama 's statement , saying it followed a `` pattern of broad pronouncements without practical follow-through . '' \nThe White House has long said all options are on the table over Libya but , for the first time on Monday , it gave a vague priority to the possible military steps being studied . \nBottom of the list is sending in ground troops , Carney told a briefing . \nEnforcing a no-fly zone was a `` serious '' option , he said , as was a U.N. arms embargo and humanitarian assistance . \nArming the rebels was also a possibility , he added . \nBut State Department spokesman P.J. Crowley appeared to contradict Carney when he noted that a February 26 U.N. Security Council resolution barred all weapons transfers to Libya . \nCrowley also denied a British newspaper report that Washington had asked Saudi Arabia to supply weapons to rebels . \nMilitary analysts say the rebels do not appear to be short of weapons and the United States would be wary of providing arms that could end up in the wrong hands and be used against U.S. forces elsewhere . \nBrian Katulis , a Middle East expert who has informally advised the White House on the turmoil sweeping the region , said the Obama administration was constrained by its reluctance to act militarily without international support . \nDefense Secretary Robert Gates reiterated on Monday that any intervention in Libya would require broad backing . \nUnderscoring the lack of consensus , Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said Moscow opposed military intervention . \nChina , a fellow veto-wielding member of the U.N. Security Council , has expressed similar misgivings . \nThe United States has deployed two amphibious assault ships off the Libyan coast , ostensibly to help with any humanitarian emergencies , while dispatching military transport aircraft to airlift stranded Egyptian refugees from neighboring Tunisia . \nOver the weekend , leading Republican and Democratic senators urged Obama to do more to help Libya 's rebels , who have fought Gaddafi 's security forces to a standstill in some areas but are all but powerless to stop repeated air strikes . \nMitch McConnell , the top Republican in the Senate , said one option was `` simply aiding and arming the insurgents , '' noting that the United States often did this during the Cold War . \nJohn Kerry , the influential Democratic chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee who is close to Obama , repeated his call for a no-fly zone and floated another idea -- bombing Libyan runways to ground Gaddafi 's warplanes . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nIf any money is spent , we must have current year dollar for dollar cuts in the war budgets , both overt and covert , for Iraq and Afghanistan to compensate . \nNot next year , THIS year . \nWe can not afford the wars we already have . \nWe can afford to pay what we have already charged for for Medicare and Social Security . \nThe choice is clear . \nWe can not afford both . \nWe do not want these wars . \nThey are not in our best interest . \nGadaffi is likely to withstand NATO and other interventions and civil war will eventually decide the outcome ... it will take a lot of headlines before a solution unfolds . \nPrincipally because Libya does n't command a territorial army and tribal allegiance will ultimately decide who survives the conflict . \nGreat , another possible intervention in the Middle East , just what we need . \nMore American lives and funds at risk , when are we going to get out of other countries internal affairs and civil wars . \nWhy do n't we leave it to the Arab League and OPEC to handle . \nWhat happens if Saudi Arabia starts to have internal problems , are we going to intervene against the government there with military force ? \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "President Barack Obama is pictured at Miami Central Senior High School on March 4, 2011.", "prop_score_1": 0.5, "generate_explanation_1": "In this rewrite, I have changed the sentence to use a more formal and authoritative tone, similar to that of a news article.

'' \nGeoff Tunnicliffe , Vancouver-based secretary general of the World Evangelical Alliance , told Reuters his organization had recently issued a code of conduct for responsible missionary work with the Vatican and World Council of Churches . \n`` I do n't see this as a blanket statement on evangelicals , which includes Pentecostals , '' he said . \nThe three groups that signed the pioneering code of conduct in June , after five years ' work , claim to represent over 90 percent of Christianity . \nWhile stressing Christian unity , Benedict deflected recent public appeals from Protestants for a relaxation of rules barring them from participating in Catholic communion . \nHe said it was a `` political misunderstanding '' to think he would come with an `` ecumenical gift '' such as permission for Protestants to receive the Catholic eucharist . \nGermany 's top Protestant bishop urged the pontiff to take `` real steps for reconciliation '' before the 500th anniversary of the Reformation in 2017 , which the Protestants would like to mark with Catholic participation . \nLuther is `` as a hinge between our two churches , because he belongs to both , '' said Lutheran Bishop Nikolaus Schneider , head of the Evangelical Church in Germany . \n`` It is time to heal the memories of the mutual injuries in the Reformation period and the subsequent history of our Churches . '' \nChancellor Angela Merkel , daughter of a Lutheran pastor , attended the service highlighted by interludes of sacred organ music by Johann Sebastian Bach and other German composers . \nErfurt , where atheism is also widespread after four decades of communism , gave the pope a cool reception . \nThere were few posters or banners announcing his presence . \nIn a shop near the cathedral , atheist Dagmar Schneidert said : `` I do n't know anyone who is enthusiastic about the visit , only 7 percent of people in Erfurt are Catholic anyway . \nIt 's wasted money that could be used for something more meaningful . '' \nThe pope is due to hold an open-air mass in central Erfurt on Saturday at which Church officials expect 85,000 Catholics . \nAt Etzelsbach , in the Eichsfeld region near the former Iron Curtain between East and West Germany , Benedict praised Catholics for keeping the faith despite pressure from `` two godless dictatorships '' -- Nazism and Communism . \n`` Eichsfeld is a very religious place , '' said Holungen Wiebert , 67 . \n`` We 're very proud to have a German pope again , for the first time in 500 years . '' \nPolish , Croatian and Bavarian flags in the crowd indicated some pilgrims had come long distances to see the pope . \nBefore leaving Berlin , Benedict met leaders of Germany 's four million Muslims and promised cooperation with them as long as they respect Germany 's constitution and the limits it sets on pluralism . \nMerkel warned Muslims last year that sharia , Islamic law , had no place in Germany . \nMuslim leaders praised the pope for confirming through the meeting that Islam was now a part of German society , but said their loyalty to the constitution was never in question . \n`` As Muslims in Germany , we have always said that we see the German constitution as a good basis for peaceful life together , '' said Bekir Alboga , head of interreligious dialogue for the Turkish mosque association DITIB . \nHe said the pope 's short address also represented a change from his controversial 2006 speech in Regensburg , where his use of a Byzantine emperor 's quote about Islam being violent and irrational provoked protests across the Muslim world . \n`` The pope has now chosen a new approach in his meeting with Muslims , '' Alboga said . \n`` I think one must look to the future and see where the possibilities for good cooperation are .

where President Bashar al-Assad is staging a violent crackdown on pro-democracy protesters . \nThe domestic political crisis and the spillover effects of the turmoil in Syria are damaging the Lebanese economy , expected to grow only 2.5 percent this year , down from 7.5 percent in 2010 , according to the International Monetary Fund . \nThe , the IMF said it expected the Lebanese economy to grow 2.5 percent this year , down from 3.7 percent in 2010 . \nAlso hanging over Lebanon are possible indictments by a U.N.-backed special tribunal of Hezbollah members in the 2005 assassination of Lebanese ex-Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri . \nHere are some of the key risks to watch : A political alliance dominated by Hezbollah , an armed Shi'ite Islamist movement backed by Syria and Iran , toppled the previous government led by Saad al-Hariri over his refusal to cut links with the tribunal seeking to try his father 's killers . \nNajib Mikati , a Sunni , was designated prime minister on Jan. 25 . \nBut disputes over cabinet posts involving Hezbollah and its Shi'ite and Christian allies , as well as President Michel Suleiman , have blocked his efforts to form a government . \nOne of the knottiest problems pits Suleiman against Michel Aoun , leader of the biggest Christian bloc in parliament , who wants to name the next interior minister as part of his share of cabinet posts . \nSuleiman insists on keeping his nominee , Ziad Baroud , in the job , whose mandate includes organising elections . \nMikati has yet to disclose how he would deal with the Hariri tribunal , which is now revising secret indictments issued in January . \nIt is not clear when they will be made public . \nHezbollah , which denies any role in Hariri 's killing , wants the next government to withdraw funding and Lebanese judges from the `` politically motivated '' court based in The Hague . \nEnjoying Saudi and U.S. support , Saad al-Hariri , the main political voice of Lebanon 's Sunni community , has become more outspoken in support of the tribunal since his government fell . \nIsrael , which fought a 34-day war with Hezbollah in 2006 , has said it will target all of Lebanon in any new conflict because of the Shi'ite group 's growing clout in government . \nThe upheaval across the Arab world has shoved Lebanon 's problems out of the limelight . \nNo foreign mediators have stepped in since joint Saudi-Syrian mediation collapsed late last year . \n\\* Publication of indictments by special tribunal Lebanon 's stability has long depended on Syria , which wields influence via Hezbollah and other local allies , even though it was forced to end a 29-year military presence in 2005 . \nThe challenge to Assad family rule in Damascus is another complicating factor in Lebanon 's already intricate politics . \nIt may energise anti-Syrian Lebanese factions , or spur Hezbollah to tighten its own grip if it feels its Syrian ally is weakening . \nSyria could easily stir strife in Lebanon , still recovering from its 1975-90 civil war , if it wanted to . \nIt blames the unrest in Syria on Islamist groups and has accused pro-Hariri politicians of inciting and arming anti-Assad protesters . \nTurmoil in Syria is already spilling over the border . \nSome Syrian dissidents , including a prominent blogger , are now in Lebanon . \nHundreds of Syrians fled into northern Lebanon on April 28 after gunfire erupted on the Syrian side of the border . \nThe instability in Syria , Lebanon 's only overland outlet , has also disrupted transport and trade . \nThe prolonged political uncertainty in Lebanon , now coupled with turmoil in Syria and elsewhere , is taking its toll on an economy badly in need of reform and infrastructure investment . \nApart from lower growth , the IMF report also forecast that inflation would rise to 6.5 percent from 4.5 percent in 2010 and that the fiscal deficit would widen to 10.5 percent of Gross Domestic Product -LRB- GDP -RRB- from 7.2 percent last year . \nThe Central Bank has ample foreign reserves of $ 31 billion to help keep the Lebanese pound LBP = stable . \nBut after three years of impressive GDP growth , warning signs are flashing . \nCaretaker Finance Minister Raya al-Hassan said on April 28 that activity in all sectors , including tourism , real estate and retail , was down . \nA capital outflow of about 1 percent of bank deposits had occurred in January , when political tension spiked . \nMany depositors have switched into dollars , despite higher interest rates offered on the Lebanese pound , prompting banks to conserve their local currency holdings , rather than buying the treasury bills on which government financing relies . \nLebanon 's public debt is expected to rise to $ 55 billion in 2011 from $ 51 billion in 2010 . \nAnalysts say it could hit $ 65 billion in the next three to five years unless the government cuts spending and boosts revenues to cut the fiscal deficit . \nBut even if a proper

Eisenhower created the council in 1956 , he called it the President 's Council on Youth Fitness . \nWhen it comes to MMS , Stewart questioned the need for a new name . \n`` Why do n't we just rename the water in the Gulf ` H20 Black ' ?

'' \nStep one , Mr Ross says , is to reach out to the Alawite community in Syria to offer them assurances that minority rights in any new Syria . \n`` The regime of President Assad has lost some large chunks of territory in several cities to the opposition , '' said Kofi Annan . \n`` As Western politicians have repeatedly warned , how do you intervene when neighbor turns against neighbor and village against village ? '' \nSo what is to be done ? \nAs the death toll inside the country mounts , none of the available options facing potential external actors is terribly attractive . \nPersistent reports that the Syrian opposition is being armed by the Saudi and Qatari authorities seem to be borne out by their greater military effectiveness in recent weeks . \nBut Western military analysts say that while the opposition forces may now be able to give a better account of themselves , they can not yet defeat the government forces ranged against them . \nThis is still a very unequal struggle . \nI spoke to the veteran US diplomat Dennis Ross - now a senior policy analyst at the US think-tank the Washington Institute for Near East Studies . \nHis point was that we are likely to see similar consequences whatever policy outside actors choose ; Syria 's sad trajectory is already set . \n`` If we stay on the current track , '' he told me , `` the sectarian divide in the country will become unbridgeable ; we will see an increasing fragmentation of the Syrian state ; and civil war will become endemic . '' \nMr Ross , a veteran negotiator who has written a standard manual on diplomacy , suggests that there are four steps , which if taken together might alter perceptions even in Damascus . \n`` Russia plays a pivotal role , '' he says . \n`` Arab governments have to make it clear to the Russians that they can either be friends with President Assad or with the rest of the Arab world . \n`` If Russia helps with a political transition in Syria then there will be benefits for Moscow across the region . '' \nSome of the protests in Syria have taken on a more sectarian nature with religious messages on banners Groups like the Friends of Syria must also make it crystal clear that minority rights in any new Syria that emerges would be assured . \n`` The Saudis need to reach out to the Alawite community in Syria to offer them assurances , '' he told me . \nThat 's step two . \nStep three , Mr Ross argues , is to bolster the Syrian National Council 's -LRB- SNC -RRB- standing ; to have it , as he puts it , `` clearly anointed '' by the outside world . \nThis , of course , is problematic since the SNC 's imperfections are well known and it has struggled to put down strong roots inside Syria itself . \nFinally , he says serious planning must begin to establish safe havens in the northern part of Syria for fleeing refugees . \nHere too Mr Ross accepts there are problems . \nTurkey would want either a UN Security Council resolution or a Nato decision to establish such a zone , and neither is likely to be forthcoming . \nBut Dennis Ross believes that these four steps taken together could help `` to change the balance of psychology '' , not least in Moscow . \nProfessor Gerges also sees the increasing recognition of the Syrian conflict as a civil war as a deliberate attempt to telegraph a diplomatic message . \n`` My take , '' he told me , `` is that statements by UN and Western officials about Syria reaching the tipping point of all-out civil war are designed to impress on Assad 's allies , particularly the Russians , the urgency and gravity of the situation and the need to exert pressure on Assad to accept the Kofi Annan peace initiative . '' \nThe badly stalled Annan plan remains the only diplomatic template for Syria 's future . \nMany worry that events have already left it languishing in irrelevance . \nMeanwhile , events on the ground are getting ever more brutal . \n`` The challenge is no longer President Assad versus the opposition , '' says Fawaz Gerges , `` but Syrians battling one another and killing each other . \nThe decision by the International Committee of the Red Cross -LRB- the ICRC -RRB- to designate the violence in Syria as `` an internal armed conflict '' is a technical step - opening up the combatants to prosecution for war crimes if they breach the Geneva Conventions on the rules of war . \nBut in reality this threshold was crossed weeks ago with serious concerns about the shelling of civilian areas by Syrian government forces and the activities of pro-government militia units . \nA number of Western governments have already offered help to opposition groups to enable them to record what is happening and to gather evidence ; evidence that could be used in future war crimes trials . \nAt a more fundamental level , the semantic debate as to whether the violence in Syria constitutes a civil war or not is largely academic . \nThe fighting is now undeniably of a duration , intensity and geographical spread that raises serious questions about the long-term survival of the regime . \nIn the real world there are no tidy distinctions : armed insurrection ; civil war ; sectarian conflict . \nThe fighting in Syria has elements of all three . \nHopes for a negotiated settlement in Syria remain alive , despite regional tensions stoked by recent air strikes attributed to Israel , says Jim Muir .

\nBoth nations have seen dramatic rises in the cost of living in recent years as well as accusations of corruption among the ruling elite . \nEgyptian President Hosni Mubarak has now been in power since 1981 -- six years before ex-Tunisian ruler Zine El Abidine Ben Ali , who was forced from office earlier this month , assumed the presidency of his country . \nThe protest movements in both nations have also been characterized by strong middle class elements . \nNo surprise then that the dissent in Tunisia has inspired some demonstrators in Egypt . \nBut below the surface there are differences between these two North African nations . \nTunisia , until the fall of Ben Ali , had a strictly controlled media , with severe restrictions on what could be reported . \nEgyptian protests got ` so big so fast ' The press in Egypt , in contrast is lively and often highly critical of the president and his government . \nCertainly the media is afforded much more freedom than its counterparts in Syria , Iraq under Saddam Hussein and Tunisia . \nAnti-government rallies are not uncommon in Egypt -- but usually protesters are heavily outnumbered by the security forces . \nThis week 's protests have been unusual because demonstrators on the streets of Cairo have outnumbered police . \nIs there as much freedom on the internet in Egypt ? \nEgypt has a less restrictive approach to social media : Facebook is freely available and often used as a means to organize protests . \nTwitter has also been used as an organizing tool . \nBy contrast the previous Tunisian government took a more hardline attitude toward the web , closing down sites and forcing protesters to rely more heavily on cellphone SMS and word-of-mouth . \nSo have the protesters in Egypt made use of the internet ? \nDefinitely , driving protests more so than in Tunisia . \nTwo groups stand out . \nThe first is the Facebook group `` We are All Khaled Said , '' its name taken from an Alexandria activist who was allegedly beaten to death by police last year . \nIt wants limits on the presidential term -- Egypt faces an election later this year -- and a raise in the minimum wage among other demands . \nBy early Tuesday it had 90,000-plus users signed up . \nThe April 6 Movement , started in 2008 on Facebook to support striking workers , shares many of the same concerns and is similarly characterized by a strong following among the young of Egypt . \nOne political group that has been largely , though not totally , absent from the protests is the banned Muslim Brotherhood , the biggest organized opposition to the government . \nIt draws its support from the poorer members of society , especially in the slums of Cairo and also Upper Egypt , but also among professionals , such as lawyers and doctors . \nThe Egyptian government frequently characterizes the Brotherhood as an extremist group and uses this -- and the terror threat -- as a reason for clampdowns on opposition . \nEarlier in the week the Brotherhood said it would not be officially participating in protests but added it would not prevent its members from taking part . \nOn Thursday the Brotherhood called for its followers to demonstrate after Friday 's weekly prayers -- the first time in the current round of unrest that the largest opposition bloc has told supporters to take to the streets . \nThe economy is clearly a factor in the unrest across North Africa . \nHow do Egypt and Tunisia compare ? \nEgyptian government being too harsh ? \nCould Cairo be the next Tunis ? \nJournalist ` trapped and beaten ' in Egypt The Egyptian economy has been in better shape in recent years than its Tunisian counterpart and has key exports such as oil on which it can rely . \nIt also depends heavily on tourism , and revenues from the Suez Canal . \nTunisia 's GDP grew by 3.4 % in 2010 and 3 % in 2009 , compared to 5.3 % and 4.6 % during the same periods in Egypt , according to the CIA Factbook . \nMeanwhile the unemployment rate in Egypt stood at 9.7 % last year , compared to 14 % in Tunisia for the same period . \nIn both cases analysts believe the true unemployment rate is substantially higher . \nOne of the complaints from many protesters in Egypt is that they have not been able to enjoy the fruits of this economic success . \nThere has also been unease that the Egyptian government , which used to involve itself in crackdowns on black market activity and speculation , has played a less active role in recent years . \nHistorically Egypt has a larger percentage of its population living below the poverty line than Tunisia -- 20 % , according to a 2005 estimate , compared to 3.8 % . \nBut many of those poor have not been involved in this week 's protests , their places taken by students , businessmen and even middle-aged couples . \nPoor Egyptians can not take time off work to protest . \nThere have been clashes between security forces and protesters in Egypt . \nIs the army going to get involved ? \nThe army in Tunisia played a crucial role : despite clashes between security forces and protesters , the military never gave its backing to the then-president . \nIn Egypt , the military has likewise rarely become involved in protests -- the last major incidents were bread riots in 1977 and a police strike in 1985 . \nEven the assassination of Hosni Mubarak 's predecessor Anwar El Sadat in 1981 involved only a small hardcore group of officers motivated by extremism . \nThis apolitical approach means that the army is held in high regard by many ordinary Egyptians . \nFurther afield , how is Egypt regarded by the United States ? \nThe United States closely monitors all developments in North Africa due to the war on terror and the threat of extremism . \nHowever , among Arab nations Egypt enjoys a near-unparalleled relationship with Washington . \nOn Tuesday Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said that while the United States backed the `` the fundamental right of expression and assembly for all people '' it believed that the `` the Egyptian government is stable and is looking for ways to respond to the legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people . '' \nBut on Wednesday Clinton said , `` We believe strongly that the Egyptian government has an important opportunity at this moment in time to implement political , economic and social reforms to respond to the legitimate needs and interests of the Egyptian people . '' \nShe also urged the government not to prevent peaceful protests or block social networking sites . \nAlso Wednesday White House press secretary Robert Gibbs was asked if the administration supports Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak . \nHe replied : `` Egypt is a strong ally . '' \nEgypt has been a major player in the Middle East peace process over the decades -- most famously the Camp David Accords signed by Sadat , Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin and U.S. President Jimmy Carter in 1978 . \nAfter Israel , Egypt is now the second biggest recipient of U.S. aid . \nWashington also regards Egypt as a key ally in the war on terror . \nIt has also been alleged that Egypt has sometimes been used by the U.S. for rendition . \nItalian prosecutors claimed in 2005 that suspected CIA agents kidnapped Osama Nasr Mostafa Hassan in Milan and that he was taken to Egypt for interrogation and torture . \nThe U.S. maintains it does not send suspects to countries that condone torture . \nEgypt has also played a key role in issues including the containment of Iran and relations between Lebanon and Syria . \nIn comparison Tunisia has its importance -- it was hit by extremist attacks in the early to mid-1980s -- but does not compare strategically . \nAnd what about the rest of the Arab world ? \nAgain , Egypt carries far more clout than its North African neighbor . \nAside from its economic and strategic weight , it has a population of more than 80 million -- nearly eight times that of Tunisia . \nThe rest of the Arab world is heavily influenced by Egyptian culture including literature , movies and TV . \nPut simply , it 's at the heart of the region in a way that Tunisia is not . \nNick Hunt and the CNN Wire contributed to this report ", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "...Egypt has been experiencing protests, similar to those in Tunisia, due to economic hardships and political unrest.

'' There have been quite a few along the lines of that last remark , enough for the former marine captain to take a few security precautions at his new Washington home , and he admits to feeling the strain . \n`` It 's kind of hard for a guy who 's dedicated his entire adult life to the health and wellbeing of this country to be called a traitor by people who , I feel , have probably sacrificed a lot less than I have , '' he said . \nHe was talking in an elegant and quiet corner of Washington 's Army and Navy Club , where he still enjoys privileges , despite his choice of employer . \nHe dresses in the manner of many former officers on both sides of the Atlantic - a tweed jacket over a boldly striped shirt - and has the crispness in his talk and the direct gaze drilled into him at marine charm school . \nThose qualities , plus his degree in classic civilisations and ancient history , got him the job of presenting the Pentagon 's side of the Iraq war to the local media in Qatar 's capital , Doha . \nIt made him an unwitting star . \nAn Egyptian-American film-maker , Jehane Noujaim , was hanging around the media center with a video camera , and most of the officers , including the then Lieutenant Rushing , thought she was making a student film about media coverage of the war . \nBut her documentary , Control Room , became one of last year 's surprise hits . \nThe film is a largely sympathetic portrayal of al-Jazeera , but it also shines a bright light on the multi-million dollar publicity machine the Pentagon built in Doha . \nAmong all the gung-ho on-message military information officers , Lt Rushing stuck out . \nHe listened to what some of the Arab journalists were saying about the war and appeared to reconsider some of his assumptions . \nIn one memorable scene , he declared himself sickened by al-Jazeera 's decision to screen pictures of dead Americans , but then realized he was not as outraged to see Iraqi bodies on the same network the following evening . \n`` It upset me on a profound level that I was n't bothered as much as the night before , '' he said in the film . \n`` It makes me hate war . '' \nThe film caused an uproar , and abuse from military and militaristic types began to flood in . \nHis favorite was : `` Six months in the desert does n't make you fucking Lawrence of Arabia . '' \nRushing recalls : `` I saved that one , because I do n't claim to be Lawrence of Arabia - just a guy who says it may be worth us trying to understand their perspective . '' \nDisplaying an apparently genuine innocence , he still can not understand why the defense department was annoyed by the film , and why he was subsequently forbidden to talk to the press . \n`` The Pentagon missed an opportunity with my case in that movie , '' he says . \n`` I would have liked to have come out and said that there are a lot of people in the military that would have reacted in the same way in that film , trying to understand the other side and wanting to do the right thing . '' \nHe left the marines last August and spent some miserable months , unemployed and eating into his modest savings , before he accepted al-Jazeera 's offer . \nThe danger Rushing now faces is that he may be accused of going from one one-sided media operation to another . \nAfter all , he is shown in Control Room criticising al-Jazeera 's bias , comparing it to Fox News `` at the other end of the spectrum '' . \nHe admits that he is unaware whether al-Jazeera 's Arabic broadcasts have got any better . \n`` I do n't know where they 're at right now . \nI do n't get a chance to watch it , and if I could I do n't understand it , '' he says . \n`` I think there 's going to be a difficult time overcoming the brand in America .

pandemic , WHO warns Health chiefs say plans to fight swine flu pandemic needed now , especially in developing world Tuesday 28 April 2009 17.37 BST The world should prepare for a possible swine flu pandemic , especially in developing nations which could be hit particularly hard by the virus , the World Health Organisation warned today . \nThe apparently new strain of the H1N1 flu , which seemingly originated in Mexico , has now been confirmed in seven countries , including the UK , New Zealand and Israel , with suspected outbreaks investigated in a number of others . \nIt has shown an apparent ability to transfer from person to person , making its rapid global threat `` a very serious possibility '' , said the WHO 's deputy head , Keiji Fukuda . \n`` Countries should take the opportunity to prepare for a pandemic , '' Fukuda told reporters in Geneva , while stressing that a pandemic was not yet inevitable . \nSpecial efforts should be made towards less rich nations which `` really get hit disproportionately hard '' by pandemics , he said . \nPatrick Wintour on UK preparations for swine flu outbreak Link to this audio Fukuda confirmed the WHO was investigating whether human-to-human transmission had been identified in a group of New York City school students who are believed to have passed the virus among themselves after returning from a trip to Mexico . \nSuch apparent cross-infection was the reason why the organization 's emergency committee last night raised its pandemic threat level to phase four out of a possible six , meaning a pandemic was possible , Fukuda said . \n`` We think that the virus showed the ability to transfer from person to person - this was an important step , '' Fukuda said . \nAny evidence of `` sustained human-to-human transmission in a number of different countries '' would see the alert raised to five , he said . \nThe vast majority of about 2,000 cases have been identified in Mexico , with 51 in the US and 15 combined in the UK , Canada , New Zealand , Spain and Israel . \nEight more countries , including France , Germany and Denmark and South Korea , are investigating possible outbreaks . \nA Scottish couple , who had been on honeymoon in Canc n , Mexico , remain in hospital but their condition is improving , the Scottish health secretary , Nicola Sturgeon , said . \n`` I am pleased to say they are continuing to improve . \nThey 're doing well , '' she said . \nAll the 150-plus deaths from the swine flu have been recorded in Mexico , with patients in other countries experiencing far less severe symptoms . \nFukuda , however , cautioned against the idea that the outbreak could be a `` mild pandemic '' , noting that the 1918 Spanish flu outbreak which killed tens of millions of people worldwide came in a series of increasingly lethal waves . \n`` I think we have to be mindful and respectful of the fact that influenza moves in ways we can not predict , '' he said . \nDr Alan McNally of Nottingham Trent University on the spread and science of swine flu Link to this audio In the UK , the Foreign Office advised against all but essential travel to Mexico as major tour operators including Thomas Cook and Airtours canceled flights to the country and sent out empty planes to repatriate holidaymakers . \nA spokesman for NHS Direct said the advice line had received almost 1,400 calls about suspected swine flu cases . \nIn the past 24 hours , it has referred 238 callers who had traveled to infected areas and were showing potential symptoms of the virus to their GPs . \nThe Wiltshire primary care trust said seven people from the county were being tested for suspected swine flu at a Health Protection Agency facility in Bristol , with results expected later today . \nGordon Brown , who later today will join a meeting of the government 's Cobra emergency committee , chaired by the health secretary , Alan Johnson , called for concerted global action to combat the virus . \n`` Swine flu is an international problem now . \nIt is across two continents , '' the prime minister said during a visit to Poland . \nThe European commission is to hold a meeting with representatives from the pharmaceutical industry tomorrow to discuss how a vaccine might be produced , the EU health commissioner , Androulla Vasiliou , said in Brussels . \nIt could take between four and six months to produce a vaccine , although anti-flu drugs already available appear to be at least partly effective in treating symptoms . \nThe 11 cases in New Zealand , among students and teachers from a single school who reported fevers and other flu symptoms on return from a visit to Mexico , are the first in the Asia-Pacific region . \nSouth Korea is also investigating a probable case . \nSpain , meanwhile , confirmed a second case . \nOfficials in China , where some cases of bird flu and another virulent respiratory infection , Sars , were initially covered up in recent years , say the country has not yet confirmed any cases but have promised full transparency . \nTwo people were also confirmed as having contracted the virus in Israel , a 26-year-old who has recovered fully and a 47-year-old man who returned from Mexico two days ago . \nHealth officials in Ireland said six people in the country were now being tested for possible exposure to the virus , which is a combination of pig , bird and human flu strains to which humans may have no natural immunity . \nSymptoms include a high fever and headache , coughing , joint ache and , in some cases , vomiting and diarrhoea . \nThe deaths in Mexico have tended to be among people in their 30s or 40s rather than the very young or old , as is the case with usual flu strains . \nUK ministers say the country is well prepared for a possible pandemic , with Johnson telling MPs the country had a stock of 33m courses of anti-flu drugs . \nIf the situation deteriorates , plans are in place for the government to warn the entire population to set up a support network of friends and relatives so they can be quickly quarantined at home if they are thought to have symptoms . \nThe friends would collect medicine on their behalf . \nIn Mexico , where officials in the capital , Mexico City , today ordered all restaurants to close , the country 's health secretary , Jos Angel C rdova , has said he expects more people to die . \nC rdova admitted that the health authorities lacked the staff to check on all suspected cases . \nSome foreign health officials fear such difficulties may be contributing to the disease 's spread . \nHe stressed it was not confirmed the outbreak had begun in Mexico and indicated it could have first emerged in the US , where health officials believe the virus was spotted in late March . \nPeru and Guatemala reported the first suspected infections in other parts of Latin America , where health officials fear swine flu has already spread but has so far gone undetected .

\nNow a team led by Timothy Crone , a marine geophysicist at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory at Columbia University , has tackled another of the great `` known unknowns '' : how much oil entered the Gulf of Mexico in the nearly three months it took for BP to gain control over its Macondo well ? \nThe team , which published their research in the journal Science , claim to have produced the first estimate of the flow rate from the well that is independent , transparent in its methodology , and reviewed by other scientists . \nThe team arrived at its estimate by analyzing video of the gushing well shot from the ocean floor . \nAnd it turns out , their numbers are very close to the final figure produced by a special team of experts assembled by the Obama administration . \nThat 's a bit of a break for government agencies who have been routinely accused by scientists and environmentalists of spinning the spill . \nCrone 's team concluded that some 56,000 to 68,000 barrels a day gushed out of the well , releasing some 4.4 m barrels into the ocean before it was capped on July 15 . \nThe study found that the oil gushed with greatest force in the first six weeks after the explosion , when there was a jagged break in the pipe leading up from the reservoir . \nThe estimate is very close to the official tally arrived at by the Obama Administration 's scientific team . \nTheir estimate was 4.9 m barrels , of which 800,000 were siphoned off by BP directly to a waiting tanker ship , leaving 4.1 m barrels in the water . \nBut the team did not make their methodology available to other scientists for review . \nBut while that agreement might lead some to immediately dismiss the study as pro-government spin , it 's worth remembering that Crone was among the first scientists to take on BP 's claim that it was impossible to estimate the flow from the well . \nCrone 's efforts , supported by Congressman Ed Markey , forced BP to release video from its undersea cameras , which showed giant clouds of oil billowing out of the broken well . \nAnd as weeks turned into months , government officials kept raising their estimates of the flow rate from 1,000 barrels a day to 19,000 by late May , and then 69,000 . \nWhen the Deepwater Horizon went down , Crone was one of a small group of people who had experience measuring oil and gas on the ocean floor . \nHe spent four years developing a technique for measuring natural releases of oil from the ocean floor , using high resolution video from underwater cameras . \nThe seemingly endless video from BP 's webcam had very low resolution and could not be analyzed . \nBack in May , when BP released its first brief clips from the ocean floor , Crone immediately asked the oil company to share more higher resolution images , to no avail it seems . \nThe researchers had access only to a few brief high resolution clips released to Congress . \n`` We clearly acknowledge the limits of our technique ; we 're unlikely to ever know the exact figure , '' he said in a statement . \nBut it is an important start . \nAs time goes on , I hope to keep track of the work of government and independent scientists , environmental organizations , and local groups on the ground to fill in the blanks around the `` known unknowns '' . \nI am looking forward to getting a first hand look at some of those efforts today aboard the Greenpeace ship , the Arctic Sunrise . \nA team of scientists is lowering monitoring equipment and gathering samples from depths of 1,000 m to gauge the effects of the remaining oil and gas in the Gulf . \nHere is their early account : The first piece of science work started on Monday morning and continued until first thing Tuesday dropping a half-tonne apparatus that includes a ` CTD ' , or `` conductivity , temperature and depth '' device , along with an array of water sampling containers and various other water monitoring instruments , down 1000m or so below the ocean 's surface . \nThey will be sharing these samples with other scientists to help build a broad , and importantly , a more independent picture of just what is going on beneath the waves of the Gulf .

'' \nEnd Quote Alan Sinclair Oil and gas analyst , Seymour Pierce During those panicky days , credit markets were in effect saying that a BP bankruptcy in the next few years was more likely than not . \nThings have calmed down since then , although the oil giant 's bonds still trade at prices comparable with companies rated `` junk '' , even though the credit rating agencies have yet to actually stick that ignominious label on BP . \nThe about turn has been extraordinary . \nBefore its money and reputation began bleeding away in the Gulf of Mexico , the oil giant was considered the safest of blue chip companies , because its debts were so low and its income so high . \n`` I think markets are -LRB- pricing in -RRB- a scenario considerably bleaker than will prove to be the case , '' says Alan Sinclair , oil and gas analyst at stock brokers Seymour Pierce . \nHe points out that just by canceling its remaining dividends this year , the company should already have enough money in hand to cover what he expects to be the $ 6bn -LRB- # 4bn -RRB- direct cost of the clean-up . \nThat is about double what the company has already forked out to date . \n`` If you add in all the civil liabilities ... I would be surprised if it comes to more than the $ 20bn they already agreed to set aside , '' Mr Sinclair adds , on the assumption that the relief wells currently being drilled succeed in stopping the leak in August . \nThe company could seek ways to limit its liability to the oil spill . \nThere is already a statutory limit under US law for oil spill costs of a mere $ 75m , but BP long ago waived this limit , as hiding behind it would have been politically untenable . \nHowever , BP had two co-investors in the Deepwater Horizon well - Anadarko of the US and Mitsui of Japan - who together own 35 % of the project . \nThe UK company has called on its partners to pay their share of the spiralling costs , and Mr Sinclair thinks that if it comes to a legal fight , BP would prevail . \nThe oil firm could also take more active steps to limit its liability , for instance through a selective bankruptcy of its US business . \nBut this would almost certainly be unpalatable to the company 's board , as it would enrage US politicians , including President Barack Obama , and probably cut off the entire US market to BP . \nSo the political reality is that BP 's liability in the Gulf of Mexico remains unlimited , and this continues to weigh down the company 's share price . \nStrategic investor or acquisition target ? \nIn this context , speculation has arisen that BP may look to an outside investor to provide a capital injection to help cover these costs . \nShare price lowest point -LRB- on 25 June -RRB- : 296p -LRB- 55 % fall -RRB- Credit default swap spread -LRB- 5 years -RRB- : 4.1 % per annum Data : Bloomberg as of 6 July 2010 Or alternatively it could fall victim to an unwanted suitor looking to buy up the company cheaply on the stock market . \nKuwait is high on the list . \nIt has had a relationship with the company ever since the UK government sold British Petroleum on the stock exchange in 1987 . \nBut Kuwait 's involvement in that flotation serves as a useful case study in the politics of such investments . \nThe Kuwait Investment Authority helpfully bought almost 30 % of the company after the sale was almost derailed by the stock market crash . \nBut the Arabs later came under pressure from Downing Street to give up hopes of a takeover and scale back their investment . \nYet today Kuwait may be the most attractive suitor . \nOn Monday , Libya voiced interest in making a grab for the company . \nResource-hungry China is also mentioned as a possibility . \nIts national oil company attempted to buy California 's Unocal in 2005 , only to be blocked by the White House on national security grounds . \nAmong fellow oil companies , the names of Exxon Mobil and Shell are also being bandied about . \nBut the resulting company might be unacceptably big and powerful for US and European anti-trust authorities . \n`` Even in Europe , the EU would have a fit about the anti-trust implications , '' says Mr Sinclair of Seymour Pierce . \nIndeed , he thinks the entire idea of an investor buying BP itself is questionable . \nLibya may be one of the less welcome suitors `` Why take on a company that is about to undertake several years of litigation ... -LRB- with -RRB- unquantifiable potential civil penalties ? '' \nInstead , he points to asset sales by BP as the likely way forwards . \nBP could for example spin off US subsidiary Atlantic Richfield to one of its rivals . \nOr it could sell individual wells and exploration rights to the Chinese . \nThis would minimize both political and anti-trust issues , and allow BP 's existing management to keep control . \n`` BP can afford to fork out $ 4bn a year by selling assets ... and being flexible about -LRB- capital expenditure -RRB- , '' notes Mr Sinclair . \nThe last possibility , and one that some market participants may be considering seriously again , is that BP will recover fully from its current debacle . \nHaving promised to set aside $ 20bn in a dedicated `` escrow '' account , some are hopeful there may be a tacit agreement with the White House that this figure will represent a cap on the company 's liabilities . \nThe pun - ancient artform , or the lowest form of wit ?

'' \nLarge sections of the Gulf of Mexico were closed to fishing , hundreds of miles of shoreline were polluted and the coastal economy , including tourism and fisheries , was disrupted before the well was capped on July 15 after the worst offshore oil leak in U.S. history . \nThe commission also criticized the White House for blocking early worst case estimates of the oil spill , which it said may have affected how fast resources were assembled to fight it . \nThe panel said the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration -LRB- NOAA -RRB- wanted to release some of its worst-case spill models on the accident in late April or early May . \nBut the White House Office of Management and Budget -LRB- OMB -RRB- blocked the move to make the information public . \nThe White House decision to block the estimates came as BP was being criticized for failing to provide accurate information on the amount of oil that was leaking . \nIn a joint statement , the directors of OMB and NOAA did not deny that NOAA 's early spill estimate was blocked . \nInstead , they said NOAA 's early analysis was incomplete because it did not take into account the measures to control the oil , like using floating booms , skimming the oil and burning it at sea . \nHowever , those measures would not have stopped the oil from spewing out of BP 's broken well . \nThe agency heads noted that other senior government officials told the public in early May what the worst-case flow rate could be . \nCommission staff said it established that the possibility of releasing the worst-case discharge figures was at least discussed at the government 's Unified Command level that oversaw efforts to plug the well and clean up the oil . \nThe panel said in the end government teams and independent scientists came up with the same approximate figure on the total amount of oil that spilled from the well -- roughly 5 million barrels of oil leaked , with 4.2 million barrels pouring into Gulf waters and the rest being recovered . \nHowever , commission staff questioned comments made by Carol Browner , the White House 's energy and climate change director , after the well was plugged that `` more than three-quarters of the oil is gone . '' \nThe panel said about 40 percent of the oil that spilled and was labeled as `` dissolved '' and `` dispersed '' was potentially being biodegraded , but was not `` gone . '' \n`` Dispersed or dissolved oil may still be present in the water , and even evaporated oil remains in the atmosphere for a short time , '' the commission said . \nThe panel also said the government went overboard in placing boom to stop the oil , especially in Louisiana , where directions went out to `` keep the parishes happy . '' \nAs a result boom was placed everywhere , including in passes where fast tidal currents made it ineffective , and in places where it was unlikely to encounter any oil . \nBoom was also put in environmentally sensitive areas such as marshes , where severe storms blew it onto delicate grasses and habitat . \n`` The boom wars never reached a resolution . \nIn many instances , responders knew that in deploying boom they were responding to the politics of the spill rather than the spill itself , '' the commission said . \n-LRB- Reporting by Tom Doggett ; Editing by Russell Blinch and David Storey -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nOtherwise it is aka The Propaganda Ministry , a dangerous path for any democracy to embark on . \nSo ... wait ... the `` most transparent White House in history '' , as they call themselves , wanted to keep information from people ? \nI wonder what else they kept from us ? \nOh , well the healthcare bill 's real effects for one I guess ...

'' \nThe assault was preceded by eight weeks of aerial bombardment . \nUS troops cut off the city 's water , power and food supplies , condemned as a violation of the Geneva convention by a UN special rapporteur , who accused occupying forces of `` using hunger and deprivation of water as a weapon of war against the civilian population '' . \nTwo-thirds of the city 's 300,000 residents fled , many to squatters ' camps without basic facilities . \nAs the siege tightened , the Red Cross , Red Crescent and the media were kept out , while males between the ages of 15 and 55 were kept in . \nUS sources claimed between 600 and 6,000 insurgents were holed up inside the city - which means that the vast majority of the remaining inhabitants were non-combatants . \nOn November 8 , 10,000 US troops , supported by 2,000 Iraqi recruits , equipped with artillery and tanks , supported from the air by bombers and helicopter gunships , blasted their way into a city the size of Leicester . \nIt took a week to establish control of the main roads ; another two before victory was claimed . \nThe city 's main hospital was selected as the first target , the New York Times reported , `` because the US military believed it was the source of rumors about heavy casualties '' . \nAn AP photographer described US helicopters killing a family of five trying to ford a river to safety . \n`` There were American snipers on top of the hospital shooting everyone , '' said Burhan Fasa'am , a photographer with the Lebanese Broadcasting Corporation . \n`` With no medical supplies , people died from their wounds . \nEveryone in the street was a target for the Americans .

Everything now has got to happen , '' John Hamilton , a Libya expert at Cross Border Information , told Reuters . \n`` That 's a hard task . \nThey have to deliver for the people ... On the other hand , this may renew the honeymoon they enjoyed when Tripoli fell , if they can put a decent government together in a short time .

'' \nBut the interim NTC authorities are also faced with a possibly more critical task , namely getting under control a clutch of anti-Gaddafi armed militias competing , so far peacefully , for ample share of funding and political representation in a post-Gaddafi Libya . \nLibya expert Alex Warren , of Frontier MEA , a Middle East and north Africa research and advisory firm , said the death of Gaddafi `` is clearly a momentous event and far more than just a symbolic one . '' \nBut he added , of the NTC militias : `` These groups need to be either carefully disbanded or integrated into the armed forces ... Questions remain about who these militias answer to , how they manage their relationships with each other and what their demands are . '' \nUnder rules drawn up by revolutionary forces who overthrew Gaddafi in September , the fall of Sirte will lead to an official declaration that Libya is liberated , which will set in motion a process toward democratic elections . \nOn declaring liberation , the NTC will move its headquarters from Benghazi to Tripoli and form a transitional government within 30 days . \nA 200-member national conference is to be elected within 240 days , and this will appoint a prime minister a month later who will nominate his government . \nThe national conference is to be given deadlines to oversee the drafting of a new constitution and the holding of elections for a parliament . \nSome worry that the politicking involved in forming a new government in the coming days may strain to the limit the alliance of convenience between provincial forces that constituted the armed opposition to Gaddafi . \nNow he is gone , the glue that held the alliance together may fade . \nWarren said it was not clear whether the current NTC chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil , widely seen as the most widely supported politician in the NTC , would step down or not . \n`` In the current absence of any other organized political institutions , it is vital that there is leadership to oversee crucial elements of the transition , including the licensing of political parties , the organization of elections , and the disbanding or reintegration of militias , '' he said . \nIn recent weeks Tripoli has seen an apparent competition for the title of top militia in the capital , where the many armed groups now exercising authority in the city portrayed themselves as the sole legitimate security force . \nU.S. Republican Senator John McCain called on the NTC during a visit to Libya last month to move quickly to get the armed groups under their control . \n`` This is an end of one era but the fight over the new government has started already , '' said Ali Abdullatif Ahmida , a Libyan political scientist at the University of New England . \n`` It all depends on how the NTC leadership heals the country and reconciles people ... or takes revenge and settles scores . \nThat may be a dangerous road .

'' \nIn a statement Friday , the company said the government 's estimates failed to account for equipment that could obstruct the flow of oil and gas , such as the blowout preventer , making its numbers `` highly unreliable . '' \nBP 's request could save it as much as $ 10.5 billion or as little as $ 1.1 billion , depending on factors such as whether the government concludes that BP acted negligently . \nFor context , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency 's entire federal budget for 2010 was $ 10.3 billion . \nPresident Barack Obama has said he wants Congress to set aside some of the money BP pays for fines for the Gulf 's coastal restoration . \nLouisiana lawmakers are pushing legislation that would require at least 80 percent of the civil and criminal penalties charged to BP , and possibly other companies , to be returned to the Gulf Coast . \nWilliam K.

Security Council resolution approved on March 17 that creates a no-fly zone above Libya and mandates the protection of civilians . \nTaking Sirte would be a symbolic victory for the rebels , who regained control of several significant towns over the weekend as coalition airstrikes continued . \nRebels said the fight to take over Sirte could be their toughest and bloodiest battle yet . \nOpposition forces claimed to have gained control of the town of Ras Lanuf on Sunday . \nThe opposition also appeared to have taken control of the key oil town of Brega . \nThose victories marked a comeback for the ragtag group of amateur soldiers who are unified by one mission : toppling Gadhafi 's nearly 42-year rule . \nOn Monday , opposition troops and Gadhafi 's security forces battled over the town of Nawfaliya . \nRebel forces told CNN they had gained control of the city . \nCNN could hear explosions and see plumes of smoke in the area of Nawfaliyah and Sirte . \nIn Misrata , where rebel fighters have said they have been under siege for weeks , CNN 's Nic Robertson saw evidence of heavy fighting and damage Monday when the government organized a trip for reporters to the city . \nGovernment forces said they were in control of Misrata , though they did not allow Robertson and others into the city center , which rebels have said they control . \nWoman alleges Libyan forces raped her Libya responds to rape claim Cousin : ` She did n't look like herself ' More than 40 foreign ministers , representatives from regional groups and top diplomats are expected to attend , including U.N.

'' \nDespite the pressure for more international action , Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov complained Monday that the coalition 's actions seemed to expand beyond the U.N. resolution 's scope . \n`` There are reports -- which go undenied -- that the air forces of the coalition conduct airstrikes on Gadhafi 's troops and support the military actions of rebels . \nThere is an obvious controversy there , '' he told reporters in Moscow . \n`` We believe that the interference into what is , essentially , an internal civil war is not sanctioned by the U.N. Security Council resolution . '' \nRussia abstained from voting on the U.N. Security Council resolution but did not veto it . \nLibyan government officials have also argued that coalition forces target only troops loyal to Gadhafi . \n`` The rebels are making their advance and no one is stopping them . \nAnd no one is even talking to them or saying , ` Where are you going ? ' \nor ` Why are you taking offensive positions and attacking the Libyan army and Libyan cities ? ' '' \nMoussa Ibrahim , a Libyan government spokesman , told reporters in Tripoli Sunday . \nHe accused NATO of `` starving the Libyan population to get Libya on its knees to beg for mercy . '' \n`` They are trying to weaken our spirits . \nThey are not trying to protect civilians , '' he said . \nNATO , which has 28 member countries , formally approved plans Sunday to take control of enforcing the U.N. Security Council resolution . \nThe coalition enforcing the resolution has been led by the United States , the United Kingdom and France . \n`` Our mandate is very clear . \nWe 're there to protect civilians against attacks . \nNo more , no less , '' NATO Secretary-General Anders Fogh Rasmussen told CNN . \nRasmussen said military commanders will make decisions on day-to-day operations within the framework NATO members agreed upon over the weekend . \nHe declined to discuss specific rules of engagement , but stressed that NATO also is enforcing an arms embargo in Libya . \n`` We are not in Libya to arm people , but to protect people , '' he said . \nOn Monday , Libyan state television displayed images of injured people in a hospital and destroyed buildings as it reported that civilians were wounded when bombs struck the central Libyan city of Sabha in the early morning hours . \nCNN was unable to independently verify that report . \nU.S. Navy Vice Adm. Bill Gortney said at the Pentagon Monday that there have been no confirmed civilian casualties in Libya as a result of coalition activity . \nAlso Monday , video footage emerged online purporting to show forces loyal to Gadhafi abusing prisoners . \nCNN was not able to confirm the authenticity of the video or determine exactly when and where it was shot . \nIn the clip , soldiers are seen taunting and slapping prisoners , who are crouched in the back of a truck with their hands bound . \nQatar announced Monday that it would recognize the Transitional National Council , composed of opposition representatives , as the sole legitimate representative of the Libyan people . \nCNN 's Reza Sayah , Arwa Damon , Nic Robertson , Paula Newton , Maxim Tkachenko and Yousuf Basil contributed to this report ", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "U.S. President Barack Obama makes his case for intervention in Libya, while diplomats prepare to meet in London.

This story is 80 times worse than I thought . '' \nThe bull market for bad news means that Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the government 's point man for the crisis , is asked regularly about damage to the well bore , additional leaks and further failures . \n`` Can you talk a little about the worst-case scenarios going forward ? '' \na reporter asked Tuesday . \n`` What happens if the relief wells do n't work out ? '' \n`` We 're mitigating risk on the relief well by drilling a second relief well alongside it , '' responded Allen , possibly the least excitable figure in this entire oil crisis . \nHe said he 's seen no sign of the additional leaks that have gotten so many bloggers in a lather . \nBut Allen 's briefings offer plenty of fodder for the apocalyptic set . \nAllen repeatedly has acknowledged that there could be significant damage to the well down below the mud line . \nThat 's why , he said , the top kill effort last month was stopped : Officials feared that if they continued pumping heavy mud into the well , they would damage the casing and open new channels for hydrocarbons to leak into the rock formation . \n`` I think that one thing that nobody knows is the condition of the well bore from below the blowout preventer down to the actual oil field itself , '' Allen said last week . \n`` We do n't know if the well bore has been compromised or not . '' \nAnd by the way , the blowout preventer is leaning , Allen said . \n`` The entire arrangement has kind of listed a little bit , '' he said . \nA government spokesman later said this development was n't new . \nEven the most sober analysts are quick to say that this is such an unpredictable well that almost anything is possible . \nBruce Bullock , director of the Maguire Energy Institute at Southern Methodist University , said additional leaks are a possible source of deep-sea plumes of oil detected by research vessels . \nBut this part of the gulf is pocked with natural seeps , he noted . \nConceivably the drilling of the well , and\\/or the subsequent blowout , could have affected the seeps , he said . \n`` Once you started disturbing the underground geology , you may have made one of those seeps even worse , '' he said . \nBut Tadeusz Patzek , a professor who is the chairman of the department of petroleum and geosystems engineering at the University of Texas , argues that the discussion has been hijacked by people who do n't know what they 're talking about . \n`` There is a lot of fast talk , which has little relation sometimes to reality , '' Patzek said . \n`` And there is jumping to conclusions by the people who have no right to jump to any conclusions because they do n't know . '' \nMuch of the worst-case-scenario talk has centered on the flow rate of the well . \nRep. Edward J. Markey -LRB- D-Mass . -RRB- \n, among the harshest critics of BP in recent weeks , generated headlines with a dramatic announcement Sunday . \n`` I actually have a document that shows that BP actually believes it could go upwards of 100,000 barrels per day , '' Markey said on NBC 's `` Meet the Press . '' \n`` So , again , right from the beginning , BP was either lying or grossly incompetent . \nFirst they said it was only 1,000 . \nThen they said it was 5,000 barrels . \nNow we 're up to 100,000 barrels . '' \nThe 1,000 - and 5,000-barrel figures -LRB- 42,000 gallons and 210,000 gallons -RRB- , however , were estimates of the actual flow ; the 100,000-barrel figure -LRB- 4.2 million gallons -RRB- in the internal BP document was based on a hypothetical situation . \nThe document stated , `` If BOP and wellhead are removed and if we have incorrectly modeled the restrictions -- the rate could be as high as -LCB- tilde -RCB- 100,000 barrels per day . '' \nThe blowout preventer and wellhead have not been removed . \nAnother undated BP document , released by Sen. Charles E. Grassley -LRB- R-Iowa -RRB- last week , has an even more dramatic worst-case scenario for the well 's flow rate , but again one based not on the well as it is but on a theoretical formulation arrived at before the drilling . \nUnder the heading `` Maximum Discharge Calculation , '' the document states that , given the most `` optimistic assumptions '' about the size of the reservoir and the intensity of the pressure at depth and assuming a total loss of well control and no inhibitions on the flow , `` a maximum case discharge of 162,000 barrels per day was estimated . '' \nAfter the Deepwater Horizon rig sank , BP recalculated that estimate based on what was known about the well . \nBP executives in early May briefed members of Congress on their conclusion : that the absolute worst-case flow rate was 60,000 barrels , with a `` more reasonable worst-case scenario '' of 40,000 barrels a day , the document states . \nToday the official government estimate of the flow , based on multiple techniques that include subsea video and satellite surveys of the oil sick on the surface , is 35,000 to 60,000 barrels a day . \nIn effect , what BP considered the worst-case scenario in early May is in late June the bitter reality -- call it the new normal -- of the gulf blowout .

Franklin Delano Roosevelt delivered a commencement address at Oglethorpe University in May 1932 , the economic crisis that had befallen the United States three years earlier had already morphed into the Great Depression : One in four Americans was out of work , banks were failing at a rate of 10 per week and the gross national product was at half its pre-crash level . \nFDR called on the federal government to `` correct , by drastic means if necessary , the faults in our economic system . '' \nThe times called for `` bold , persistent experimentation , '' he declared . \nStrictly by the numbers , today 's economic crisis is , fortunately , not as severe as the Great Depression was . \nBut that 's cold comfort to the millions of Americans who have lost their jobs , homes , health care and retirement savings . \nIn the 1930s , FDR was elected president in hopes of reviving the nation 's economy . \nPeople reasonably expect government to act boldly . \nI 've spoken at length about the current economic crisis with other governors , including Deval Patrick -LRB- Mass. -RRB- , David Paterson -LRB- N.Y. -RRB- , Jim Doyle -LRB- Wis. -RRB- , Jennifer Granholm -LRB- Mich. -RRB- and Ted Strickland -LRB- Ohio -RRB- . \nWe agree that our states -- however diverse they may be -- have similar needs and problems that should be addressed by the economic recovery package being developed in Washington . \nThat can best be achieved if Congress and the new administration keep in mind the following principles : First , the states , local governments and the federal government must be full partners in the recovery process . \nWorking with counties and municipalities , states have mechanisms in place to pump stimulus funds into the economy quickly and responsibly . \nBut we do n't have the federal government 's financial capacity or borrowing authority . \nAny recovery effort should reflect our mutual strengths . \nSecond , the package should be large . \nSome estimates put the cost of the economic crisis next year at $ 700 billion , or about 4 percent of gross domestic product . \nTo offset this , the cumulative value of the stimulus plan should be $ 1 trillion over two years . \nThis is a large sum , but if the spending is executed effectively , it should be a significant investment in our country 's physical and human resources that will pay long-term dividends while also creating and saving jobs . \nThe stimulus should be roughly divided into five categories : infrastructure , countercyclical programs , housing , education block grants and middle-class tax cuts . \nFor every billion dollars we spend on infrastructure , we can put upwards of 20,000 people back to work . \nOn one hand , we 've learned painful lessons about the need to modernize our bridges and levees . \nOn the other hand , we must think broadly about the idea of infrastructure : How many hours do people waste circling airports because our air-traffic control systems are outdated ? \nWe must commit to improving our transportation system , energy grid , Internet technology , ports , public housing and school facilities . \nUnless we also help states shore up their safety-net social programs , the economic impact of the federal stimulus will be negated . \nMost states are constitutionally required to balance their budgets . \nGiven the sharp decline in state revenue , we are not able to support , let alone increase , spending to meet growing demands for basic needs such as unemployment insurance , food assistance programs and health care -- including mental-health services to those with developmental disabilities . \nMost states are facing cuts to these essential services , reductions that will exact an enormous toll on our most vulnerable citizens and remove money and jobs from the economy just when we need to promote growth . \nPut another way , even if the federal government dedicates a large sum to infrastructure , cutbacks in state and local safety-net programs would cancel out much of the effect of the stimulus . \nOver two years , the federal government should boost its countercyclical spending by at least $ 250 billion . \nIt can do so by increasing the Federal Medical Assistance Percentages ; the federal share of Medicaid costs ; and other health-care-related programs such as reimbursement to hospitals for treating the uninsured , Temporary Assistance for Needy Families and child-care grants . \nMany state unemployment trust funds are already depleted . \nRising unemployment rates and reduced revenue over the next few months are likely to trigger major payroll tax increases in 2009 . \nThis harm could be partly mitigated by doubling proposed federal funding for state unemployment trust funds under the Unemployment Insurance Modernization Act , which would provide incentives to cover vulnerable low-wage and part-time workers who are often denied benefits . \nUnless we strike at the cause of the meltdown -- the collapse of the housing market -- our economy will continue spiraling downward . \nThe federal recovery package should include funding for state housing mortgage authorities and for programs that help people restructure their mortgages , stay in their homes and find new shelter if evicted . \nIf we are to pursue relief and recovery , it 's essential that we continue developing a workforce that is able to meet the demands of the 21st-century economy . \nAt least $ 250 billion in preschool-through-college education block grants would help states meet their school budget obligations ; more important , such grants would enable greater strides toward universal early childhood education and fully funded programs for special-needs students -- improving the situation today and laying the foundation for a better tomorrow . \nA sizable middle-class tax cut is key . \nOver the past decade , median family income has failed to keep pace with inflation , especially given the sharply rising costs of health care and education . \nMost Americans have lost ground . \nRelief for the middle class would help our families weather the storm and also boost economic demand . \nIn 1932 , Roosevelt warned against being of `` faint heart , fearful of change , sitting tightly on the rooftops in the flood . '' \nHis words are still prescient today . \nWe must be bold -- $ 1 trillion bold . \nAmerica has abundant resources and a generous , ambitious spirit . \nIf we work together , we 'll emerge stronger and more prosperous than ever . \nThe writer , a Democrat , is governor of New Jersey .

Paul Zukunft said . \nBP 's Macondo well , currently plugged from gushing oil for the first time in three months , is located 50 miles off the coast of Louisiana . \nThis is a developing story . \nRefresh page for updates . \nLast complete story appears below : MIAMI -- A tropical depression racing toward the Gulf of Mexico Thursday increased pressure on BP and the U.S. government to decide whether to evacuate dozens of ships at the site of the ruptured oil well . \nThe National Hurricane Center in Miami said a cluster of thunderstorms in the Bahamas formed into a tropical depression Thursday morning . \nIt could reach the spill site within two and a half days , said Lexion Avila , a senior hurricane specialist . \nShe said they were awaiting an evacuation order for key vessels . \nWork on plugging the well is at a standstill just days before the expected completion of a relief tunnel to permanently throttle the free-flowing crude . \nWorse yet , the government 's spill chief said foul weather could require reopening the cap that has contained the oil for nearly a week , allowing oil to gush into the sea again for days while engineers wait out the storm . \n`` This is necessarily going to be a judgment call , '' said retired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , who was waiting to see how the storm developed before deciding whether to order any of the ships to leave . \nBP spokesman Scott Dean said Thursday morning that no decisions had been made yet . \nCrews had planned to spend Wednesday and Thursday reinforcing with cement the last few feet of the relief tunnel that will be used to pump mud into the gusher and kill it once and for all . \nBut BP put the task on hold and instead placed a temporary plug called a storm packer deep inside the tunnel , in case it has to be abandoned until the storm passes . \n`` What we did n't want to do is be in the middle of an operation and potentially put the relief well at some risk , '' BP vice president Kent Wells said . \nIf the work crews are evacuated , it could be two weeks before they can resume the effort to kill the well . \nThat would upset BP 's timetable , which called for finishing the relief tunnel by the end of July and plugging the blown-out well by early August . \nScientists have been scrutinizing underwater video and pressure data for days , trying to determine if the capped well is holding tight or in danger of rupturing and causing an even bigger disaster . \nIf the storm prevents BP from monitoring the well , the cap may simply be reopened , allowing oil to spill into the water , Allen said . \nBP and government scientists were meeting to discuss whether the cap could be monitored from shore . \nAs the storm drew closer , boat captains hired by BP for skimming duty were sent home and told they would n't be going back out for five or six days , said Tom Ard , president of the Orange Beach Fishing Association in Alabama . \nIn Florida , crews removed booms intended to protect waterways in the Panhandle from oil . \nHigh winds and storm surge could carry the booms into sensitive wetlands . \nAlso , Shell Oil began evacuating empman for Transocean , the owner of the rig leased by BP , confirmed the existence of the reports to The Associated Press . \n`` As part of Transocean 's unwavering commitment to safety and rigorous maintenance discipline on all our rigs , we proactively commissioned the safety survey and the rig assessment review , '' Transocean spokesman Lou Colasuonno said in an e-mail early Thursday . \n`` A fair reading of those detailed third-party reviews indicates clearly that while certain areas could be enhanced , overall rig maintenance met or exceeded regulatory and industry standards and the Deepwater Horizon 's safety management was strong and a culture of safety was robust on board the rig . '' \nThe `` Great Snowstorm '' came to an end . \nThis storm produced the heaviest snowfall over the largest area of any storm studied by weather historian David Ludlum . \nAccumulations exceeded 10 inches from the Ohio Valley across much of the Atlantic coast north of Georgia . \nWashington , DC reported 13 inches with 18 inches at Baltimore , Maryland , 18 to 36 inches near Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , 15 to 20 inches at new York city , and 20 to 30 inches over southern New England . \nThe second severe arctic outbreak of the year hit the United States . \nA vast anticyclone from British Columbia to Louisiana , was centered over Kansas at 30.50 inches . \nThe zero line went into Texas with the temperature at Amarillo falling from 55 degrees to 1 degree below zero and Oklahoma city dropping from 62 degrees to 10 degrees . \nA winter storm produced 61 inches of snow at Rye , Colorado , and wind gusts to 100 mph in Utah . \nThe storm then spread heavy snow from the Texas Panhandle to Indiana . \nTulia , Texas received 16 inches of snow , and up to 14 inches blanketed western Oklahoma . \nA powerful Pacific storm battered the coast of southern California . \nWinds gusting to 65 mph uprooted trees in the San Diego area , while Los Angeles recorded a barometric pressure reading of 29.25 inches of mercury -- the lowest in 100 years of official record keeping . \nHeavy snow fell across the Prince Williams Sound area and the Susitna Valley of southern Alaska . \nValdez was buried under 64.9 inches of snow in less than two days , including a record 47.5 inches in 24 hours . \nUp to 44 inches of snow was reported in the Susitna Valley . \nThe heavy snow sank a half dozen vessels in the harbor . \nBitterly cold air prevailed across the great lakes and the northeastern U.S. Alpena , Michigan dipped to 28 degrees below zero to tie its record low for January . \nRochester , New York plunged to 17 degrees below zero for a new record low temperature for January . \nBoston , Massachusetts mean temperature for the day was only 2 degrees -- the city 's coldest day in 26 years . \nWatertown , New York was the cold spot in the nation , with a morning low of 43 degrees below zero . \nWilliston , North Dakota recorded 12.6 inches of snow in 24 hour for its greatest 24 hour snowfall on record . \nThe temperature plunged to 50 degrees below zero at Big Black River , Maine for the state 's coldest temperature on record .

'' \nSenator Joseph Biden , the Democrats ' leading voice on foreign policy , predicted that the martial rhetoric would not rescue the president 's standing in the polls , where Mr Bush has lower ratings than presidents Reagan or Clinton at this stage of their second terms . \n`` I think the American people are a lot smarter than that , '' he said . \nHowever , Andrew Kohut , head of the Pew Research Centre , a Washington polling organization , said the broader ties outlined by the president might strike a chord with the public . \n`` For many Americans the premise for the war was that Saddam Hussein was a dangerous man and we are better off without him , '' he said . \n`` It was not so much premised on a direct link between Saddam and al-Qaida , as on the suggestion that we face a threat from that part of the world and if we leave a mess it will be a danger to us . '' \nThough one poll showed that the speech drew the smallest audience of any Bush presidential appearance , another poll by Gallup found that it may have served its purpose in bolstering the resolve of viewers , at least temporarily . \nOf an estimated 23 million who watched , 54 % thought the US was winning the war , compared with 44 % before the speech . \nBut only 23 % were registered Democrats - and the boost the president received was weak compared with the upsurge following similar set-piece speeches in the past . \nThe address was also savaged abroad . \nA Labor MP , Lynne Jones , said any attempt to suggest that it was a response to the September 11 attacks was `` absolute nonsense '' . \n`` What they have ensured , in invading Iraq , is they have actually promoted al-Qaida 's involvement in other countries , including Iraq .

'' \nThe news of Gaddafi 's capture and killing came minutes after reports that his hometown Sirte had fallen amid raids by NATO warplanes , extinguishing the last significant resistance by loyalist forces . \nThe capture of Sirte and the death of Gaddafi means Libya 's ruling NTC should now begin the task of forging a new democratic system which it had said it would get under way after the city , built as a showpiece for Gaddafi 's rule , had fallen . \nSome fear instability may linger and unsettle that process . \n`` Gaddafi is now a martyr and thus can become the rallying point for irredentist or tribal violence -- perhaps not in the immediate future but in the medium-to-long term , '' said George Joffe , a north Africa expert at Cambridge University . \n`` The fact that NATO can be blamed for his death is worrying , in terms of regional support , and may undermine the legitimacy of the National Transitional Council .

'' \nBut he added , of the NTC militias : `` These groups need to be either carefully disbanded or integrated into the armed forces ... Questions remain about who these militias answer to , how they manage their relationships with each other and what their demands are . '' \nUnder rules drawn up by revolutionary forces who overthrew Gaddafi in September , the fall of Sirte will lead to an official declaration that Libya is liberated , which will set in motion a process toward democratic elections . \nOn declaring liberation , the NTC will move its headquarters from Benghazi to Tripoli and form a transitional government within 30 days . \nA 200-member national conference is to be elected within 240 days , and this will appoint a prime minister a month later who will nominate his government . \nThe national conference is to be given deadlines to oversee the drafting of a new constitution and the holding of elections for a parliament . \nSome worry that the politicking involved in forming a new government in the coming days may strain to the limit the alliance of convenience between provincial forces that constituted the armed opposition to Gaddafi . \nNow he is gone , the glue that held the alliance together may fade . \nWarren said it was not clear whether the current NTC chairman Mustafa Abdel Jalil , widely seen as the most widely supported politician in the NTC , would step down or not . \n`` In the current absence of any other organized political institutions , it is vital that there is leadership to oversee crucial elements of the transition , including the licensing of political parties , the organization of elections , and the disbanding or reintegration of militias , '' he said . \nIn recent weeks Tripoli has seen an apparent competition for the title of top militia in the capital , where the many armed groups now exercising authority in the city portrayed themselves as the sole legitimate security force . \nU.S. Republican Senator John McCain called on the NTC during a visit to Libya last month to move quickly to get the armed groups under their control . \n`` This is an end of one era but the fight over the new government has started already , '' said Ali Abdullatif Ahmida , a Libyan political scientist at the University of New England . \n`` It all depends on how the NTC leadership heals the country and reconciles people ... or takes revenge and settles scores . \nThat may be a dangerous road .

'' \nA MARINE ECOSYSTEM MOST UNDER THREAT Various seabirds , like the brown pelican , which was taken off the endangered list last year , and five species of endangered sea turtles , all just starting to nest in the area , also are at high risk and are more visible to the public . \nBut oysters are likely to be the region 's great unsung victims , whose destiny near the bottom of the food chain will be registered throughout the Gulf Coast marine environment . \nAlthough decades of water pollution , much of it runoff from farms , storm sewers and industry , has taken a toll on aquatic life along the U.S. Gulf Coast , the region still is home to the world 's last , largely intact network of oyster reefs . \nCompared with other types of marine ecosystems , oyster reefs on the whole are considered by scientists to be the most environmentally damaged globally , declining by 85 percent over the past several decades . \nThe Chesapeake Bay along the U.S. Eastern Seaboard , for example , has lost 99 percent of its once-bountiful oyster beds , said Mike Beck , a senior marine scientist for the environmental group Nature Conservancy . \nWith over half of its reefs still left , the Gulf Coast is the world 's `` last , best '' chance of maintaining a healthy oystery , Beck said . \nThe Gulf Coast leads U.S. commercial oyster production , accounting for nearly 70 percent of a total national catch valued at $ 131.6 million in 2008 , the last year for which government figures are available . \nWith the oil slick taking longer than first expected to reach the main coastal areas , fish and wildlife agencies have scurried to cordon off the most ecologically sensitive areas with containment booms they hope will minimize the damage . \nIn Alabama , the spill poses a serious setback to efforts to enhance oysteries and other marine resources . \nThe state recently launched an ambitious restoration program that includes temporary closure of its publicly owned oyster reefs and the relocation of 6 million pounds of oysters from upper Mobile Bay to other areas , said Chris Denson , a marine biologist at the state Conservation Department . \nSeparately , the Nature Conservancy secured nearly $ 3 million in federal economic stimulus money to fund a pilot program to test three kinds of artificial reef structures along a salt marsh island near Mobile Bay . \nThe project was more than half complete when it was put on hold due to the oil spill . \nWe welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data . \nViews expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . \nWe let our government run a muck and allow multi national corporations to bypass safeguards , just to save money . \nWe can blame it on BP , but who elected the politicians that allowed the safeguards to be overlooked ? \nThe BP spill is yet another symptom of our self-destructive personalities . \nThe post I see here are nothing less than vile . \nThe problem that people do not understand is that one kind of fuel as the Earth surges in population is not a simple wind , sunlight or sugar cane propistion as we see with the killing of the Rain Forrest to grow sugar Cane The so called green energy plans including oil must be integrated together . \nWhat is going to come down to is energy managemnet . \nPeople tend to shoot off thier moouths without all the facts at hand and forget that we are animals -LRB- Mamals -RRB- too . \nThis discussion is now closed . \nWe welcome comments on our articles for a limited period after their publication . \nAn ultra-low latency infrastructure for electronic trading and data distribution A connected approach to governance , risk and compliance Our next generation legal research platform ", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "The oyster, a vital component of the Gulf Coast's marine ecosystem, is facing a significant threat due to the oil spill.", "prop_score_1": 0.5, "generate_explanation_1": "The original sentence is quite lengthy and includes several complex terms, making it difficult to understand for a general audience.

\nIn the era of Gorbachev and Reagan , political will created treaties that still successfully control many types of WMD . \nRevived , they would provide the basis for global controls . \nIran must not be dealt with in isolation . \nAs the Iran debate unfolds , we will no doubt again hear about the joint intelligence committee . \nWe should follow the advice of a former head of the committee , Sir Paul Lever , to remove US intelligence officials from around the JIC table , where they normally sit . \nOnly in this way , argues Lever , can the British take a considered view themselves . \nWe need to be clear that our MPs have no mandate to support an attack on Iran . \nDuring the election campaign , the government dismissed any suggestion that Iran might be attacked as ridiculous scaremongering . \nIf Blair has told Bush that Britain will prevent Iran 's nuclear weapons `` come what may '' , we need to be equally clear that nothing short of an election would provide the mandate for an attack . \nDan Plesch is the author of The Beauty Queen 's Guide to World Peace , about which he is speaking at the Edinburgh Book Festival Letters for publication should be sent to : letters@guardian.co.uk If you need help using the site : userhelp@guardian.co.uk Call the main Guardian and Observer switchboard : Dan Plesch : How Bush would gain from war with Iran This article was published on guardian .

'' \n \nsaid Wells , who said the leak was discovered after two of the three valves closed . \nIf it works , the cap will be a temporary fix until BP can drill into the gusher to plug it for good from underground , where the seal will hold better . \n`` Bear with us , '' Wells said . \nThe leak was discovered after two of the three valves on the cap that can open or shut the device had been closed , bringing BP and government scientists , who are also watching , tantalizingly close to starting a 48-hour test of how the well and cap withstand the pressure . \nWells had warned that the process of getting ready and then choking the oil a mile below the sea , at a depth only submarine robots can reach , consisted of many precise , individual steps . \n`` Any one of these steps can take longer than anticipated , '' Wells said Wednesday , before the leak disrupted work . \nRetired Coast Guard Adm. Thad Allen , the Obama administration 's point man on the disaster , said at a briefing it 's not clear yet whether the cap , which was mounted on the well Monday , will ultimately be used to shut in the oil or to channel it through pipes to collection ships overhead . \n`` I have a high degree of confidence we can substantially decrease the oil coming into the environment , '' Allen said . \nThe cap remains a temporary fix , he said , until one of two relief wells BP is drilling can reach the gusher underground and plug it permanently with heavy drilling mud and cement . \n`` Make no mistake , the number one goal is to kill the well ... to stop it at the source , '' he said . \nThe test will involve closing off all three openings in the cap to the Gulf , in theory stopping the oil leaking into the Gulf . \nBP will be monitoring pressure under the cap . \nHigh pressure is good , because it shows there 's only a single leak . \nLow pressure , below 6,000 pounds per square inch or so , could mean more leaks farther down in the well . \nBP expects to keep the oil trapped in the cap for 48 hours before it decides if the approach is working . \nWith the leaking pipe replaced , BP had to start from a few steps back to resume preparations for the test . \nPreparations included letting more oil pour out of the cap temporarily and turning off a pipe that had been sending some of the oil to a collection ship , so that the full force of all the erupting crude would go into the cap . \nEngineers also had to recheck equipment and move undersea robots that perform the work back into position . \nWells was hesitant to give a firm timeframe for when the test could start , but expected it to be Thursday . \n`` We 're going to keep moving forward with this , '' Wells said . \nAllen said a committee of scientists and engineers will monitor the results and assess every six hours , and end the test after 48 hours to evaluate the findings . \n`` I was gung-ho for this test and I remain gung-ho for this test , '' he said Wednesday . \nIf the cap works , it will enable BP to stop the oil from gushing into the sea , either by holding all the oil inside the well machinery like a stopper or , if the pressure is too great , channeling some through lines to as many as four collection ships . \nAllen said the testing will also help prepare for the hoped-for permanent fix by the relief wells . \nThe mapping of the sea floor that was done to prepare for the cap test and the pressure readings will also help them determine how much mud and cement will be needed to seal off the well underground . \nDrill work was stopped on one relief well because it was not clear what effect the testing of the cap could have on it . \nWork on the other relief well had already been stopped according to plan . \nThe government estimates 1.5 million to 2.5 million gallons are leaking every day . \nAs of Thursday , the 86th day of the disaster , between 93.5 million and 184.3 million gallons of oil had spewed into the Gulf since the Deepwater Horizon rig leased by BP exploded April 20 , killing 11 workers .

'' \nIn 2008 , propelled by a housing bubble , speculative buying of new debt instruments and a commodities boom , oil prices exceeded $ 100 per barrel for the first time and soared to a record high above $ 147 , helping trigger financial crisis and the worst slump since World War II . \nThis time , oil prices have soared following the loss of around 1.6 million barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- of Libyan oil , uprisings across the Middle East and North Africa and rapid economic growth in China , India and other developing economies . \nUsing the oil expense indicator , economists say Brent crude , the international oil benchmark , would need to be in the low $ 90s per barrel to be under the 4.5 percent danger mark . \nIn fact , Brent hit a two-and-a-half-year high of more than $ 127 per barrel in April and , with the exception of an intra-day dip Tuesday , has been over $ 100 for six months . \nEven after a fall of more than $ 20 from its early-August high on worries over a slowdown in the developed economies , Brent is still not far off $ 110 per barrel . \nOil is a key global cost because it is crucial to every part of the economy , powering manufacturing and the production of food and other commodities , fuelling transport as well as being a building block for industries such as plastics and electronics . \nIf it is too high for too long , the results are dramatic . \n`` The last two times that energy as a share of global GDP neared ... the current level , the world economy experienced severe crises : the double dip recession of the 1980s and the Great Recession of 2008 , '' Merrill Lynch analysts led by Francisco Blanch said in a note to clients . \nEconomists reinforce their warnings over the possibility of an impending slowdown with data showing that oil demand has begun to shrink in some countries in response to high prices . \nOil data lags , but the latest U.S. figures , for May , show a drop of 4.7 percent year-on-year in U.S. gasoline demand . \nDeutsche Bank analyst Adam Sieminski says he is concerned by a trend towards lower U.S. oil demand evident since last summer : `` The last time U.S. oil demand was falling was in 2007 and early 2008 , '' Sieminski said in a note written with analyst Michael Lewis . \n`` This was a leading indicator of the economic troubles that would hit the U.S. in the middle of 2008 . '' \nAnalysts differ on exactly how high oil prices need to be and how long they need to stay up before they slow growth . \nSome economists argue the impact of oil prices has been exaggerated , and others note that not all recessions are caused by oil , such as slowdowns in the early 1990s and again a decade later . \nBut most economists argue there is a level at which fuel input costs become incompatible with continuing economic growth . \nJames Zhang , an analyst at Standard Bank , says the danger level comes with the oil expense indicator at around 5 percent : `` $ 100 per barrel represents about 5 percent for the ` oil expense indicator ' , which we think would be a threshold on an annual average level to potentially kill off global growth , '' he said . \n`` Absent any shocks , I do n't believe an oil price , say in the range of $ 100 to $ 130 , will necessary bring a recession itself , but a slower growth is almost ensured -- another sharp jump in oil prices could act as a shock , '' Zhang said . \nBarret said record high oil and commodity prices were putting unsustainable pressure on household expenditure , and while he like other economists is reluctant to predict recession , he thinks the warnings should be heeded : `` There is still a chance that oil prices will go down very significantly , and that could be a strong support to the economy . \nBut if prices stay near $ 110 per barrel until the end of the year , we will have a major problem by the start of 2012 , '' he said . \n`` We either get sharply lower prices or a recession that will bring down prices . \nEither way , oil prices must come down .

Plater , who chaired a legal task force for a special commission in Alaska following the Exxon Valdez oil tanker spill there in 1989 . \n`` The hit in terms of economics is going to be measurable and it 's going to be greater , '' said Plater , a law professor at Boston College , who noted that the population and levels of investment along the Gulf coast dwarfed those at stake in remote Alaska more than 20 years ago . \nBP is the most exposed to potential damages in the case . \nThe London-based oil giant is the owner of the ruptured undersea well spewing out oil at an unchecked rate of about 5,000 barrels -LRB- 210,000 gallons\\/795 ,000 liters -RRB- per day . \nThe resulting oil slick threatens fisheries , beaches and wildlife refuges -- and livelihoods -- along the Gulf Coast . \nOther companies involved in the spill include Transocean Ltd , owner of the Deepwater Horizon drilling rig licensed to BP , and Halliburton Co , which provided a variety of services on the rig and was involved in cementing the well to stabilize its walls . \nFamilies of some of the 11 workers who died in the April 20 Deepwater Horizon rig blast have filed wrongful-death claims , and people who were injured have also taken legal action . \nThe companies also face lawsuits brought by fishermen , restaurants , charter boat companies , hotels and rental property owners . \nGulf Coast states could also sue , as could municipalities , for lost tax revenues , and shipping companies if traffic into major ports or the Mississippi River is disrupted . \n`` You 're talking about the entire economic structure of five states and all their ancillary businesses , '' said Tim Howard , a Tallahassee lawyer who last week filed one of Florida 's first class-action suits over the oil spill . \n`` You 're talking maybe about close to a half a trillion dollar economy here , '' Howard added . \n`` This is why you do not mess around and play around with something toxic .

'' \nHowever , Heseltine has his backers in the city , birthplace of the Beatles and home to one of Europe 's most successful soccer clubs . \n`` Heseltine is respected across the political divide as somebody who has put Liverpool 's case regularly , '' said Joe Anderson , the Labor leader of the city council . \n`` All governments have n't got to grips with the problems that inner cities faced . \nHe 's right to make the case that government seems to be London-centric , '' he told Reuters . \n`` Liverpool was once an economic powerhouse of the Commonwealth and he sees the potential here .

'' \nHuman hair , however , proved more effective - in part because the wool had been processed and so lost its lanolin coating , which naturally repels water and holds grease to keep sheep warm . \n`` Human hair grease acts as a spreading agent , to help the oil form a film on the surface . '' \nThe idea of using human hair to mop up oil spills dates from the Exxon Valdez accident in 1989 . \nWatching the unfolding disaster on television , Alabama hair stylist Phil McCory noticed how hard it was for volunteers to clean oil from otters ' fur , and thought to himself : `` If animal fur can trap and hold spilled oil , why ca n't human hair ? '' \nPrisoners in Manila bagged up their hair for a 2006 oil spill So he staged a home oil spill to test this theory , pouring a gallon of used motor oil into his son 's paddling pool . \nHe then dunked in a pair of his wife 's pantyhose stuffed with clippings from his salon . \nWithin two minutes , the DIY boom had sucked up all the oil . \nHe then parlayed this brainwave into a business making oil spill mats from hair purchased in China . \nFor the past 10 years , his company has worked with the Matter of Trust charity to establish a hair recycling system to find a use for the all the hair and fur cut off by stylists and pet groomers each day . \nThe charity 's figures suggest this amounts to 370,000 pounds of hair , and 300,000 pounds of fur , a day in the US alone . \nWhile fur , horse hair and feathers are also used in the booms , the charity says human hair seems to be most effective as it has less natural oil and so more capacity to catch spilled oil . \nA regular part of the BBC News Magazine , Who , What , Why ? \naims to answer some of the questions behind the headlines To make a hair boom , first cut the legs off a pair of tights , and fit the open end over a wide plastic pipe - this makes it easier to feed the hair and fur into the stocking . \nOnce it 's full , tie off the end and cover the resulting sausage in a strong mesh . \nWhile the charity welcomes all donations , there are a few caveats - it prefers freshly-washed hair and fur , and hair to be from the head only . \nThis is because each boom is hand-made , and its volunteers are unlikely to want to handle filthy - or intimate - off-cuts . \nBut what happens to all the oil-soaked hair ? \nAmong the options tried by the charity include feeding the whole mess to worms to break down into fertiliser .

Thad Allen , the Obama administration 's point man for the oil spill , said that since the leak began , 4 million gallons -LRB- 15 million liters -RRB- of crude have been siphoned off the leaking well using tubes and caps . \nAn additional 18 million gallons -LRB- 68 million liters -RRB- have been skimmed from the ocean surface , he said . \nThe skimmed liquid is generally only 10 to 15 percent oil . \nNegotiations were still ongoing Friday to find a buyer for all that captured oil , BP spokesman Mark Proegler said . \n`` There 's nothing special about it , other than everyone 's looking at it , '' he said . \nIt 's possible the oil wo n't even be sold to a refinery directly by BP or processed in the Gulf . \nBig oil companies have trading departments that commonly swap barrels of crude with other firms or sell them to traders who could route the oil across the globe , Langlinais said . \nOnce that crude hits a refinery , the oil could end up in a wide array of fuels and products including gasoline , diesel , heating oil , asphalt and plastic -- including the bags used at grocery stores , the cases for cell phones and microwaves . \nIt also can be used as raw feed for chemical companies . \n`` I think it 's an eye-opening experience for people who do n't give it much thought when they finally realize how much their lives depend on oil , '' Langlinais said . \nBP has said it plans to boost its ability to directly capture oil gushing from the well by early next week . \nA semi-submersible drilling rig would capture and burn up to 420,000 gallons -LRB- 1.59 million liters -RRB- of oil daily . \nOnce on board , the oil and gas collected from the well will be sent down a boom and burned at sea . \nA drill ship already at the scene can process a maximum of 756,000 gallons -LRB- 2.86 million liters -RRB- of oil daily that 's sucked up through a containment cap sitting on the well head . \nFederal officials are still reviewing BP 's plan to build a new containment system designed to capture more oil and be more durable during hurricane season . \nAllen said the plan could be revised based on calculations of how much oil is spilling from the well . \nIt 's unclear how much the captured oil will be worth once it 's sold . \nOil was trading around $ 74 a barrel Friday , but BP officials said they expect to get a lower price than normal because the oil captured from the leak is laced with methanol . \nBP is injecting methanol as an antifreeze into the inside of the containment cap sitting over the gushing well to prevent the buildup of an ice-like slush that can clog the pipes . \nUnder its operating agreement , BP gets 65 percent of the net revenue made by selling oil from the leak site . \nAfter deducting for royalty payments owed to the government , it will donate its share of the proceeds to the wildlife fund . \nAnadarko Petroleum Corp. , which is entitled to 25 percent of the oil revenue , is still discussing what to do with its share of the money when the oil is sold , Anadarko spokesman Matt Carmichael said . \n`` We 're committed to doing the right thing , '' he said . \nA subsidiary of Mitsui & Co. . \nLtd. , which has a 10 percent stake , declined to comment . \nMeanwhile , the oil seemed to keep coming ashore unabated Saturday morning . \nGlobs of tar lined the white sands of Orange Beach , Alabama -- some the size of small pancakes . \nTony Tingle of Trussville , Alabama , said it was even worse the evening before . \n`` It was actually crude oil , not tar balls . \nAll the cleaning crews flooded in . \nThe skimming boats came in pretty quickly , helicopters were circling , and a bunch of boats came in . \nIt smelled like a machine shop , '' Tingle said . \nDuring a flight over the Gulf of Mexico , aerial spotter Sean Brumley said he saw an oily sheen and brown patches of oil floating for miles -LRB- kilometers -RRB- off the coast . \n`` The Gulf looks like it has chicken pox , '' Brumley said .

'' \nSecretary of State Hillary Clinton said it was `` time to stop this unnacceptable bloodshed '' in Libya . \nA group of army officers issued a statement urging fellow soldiers to `` join the people '' and help remove Gaddafi . \nThe justice minister resigned in protest at the `` excessive use of violence '' against protesters and diplomats at Libya 's mission to the United Nations called on the Libyan army to help overthrow `` the tyrant Muammar Gaddafi . '' \nBoth Libya and Venezuela denied reports that Gaddafi had fled to the South American country ruled by his friend and fellow revolutionary President Hugo Chavez . \nLibyan state television said Gaddafi would give a speech shortly . \nTwo Libyan fighter jets landed in Malta , their pilots defecting after they said they had been ordered to bomb protesters , Maltese government officials said . \nAn analyst for London-based consultancy Control Risks said the reported air strikes indicated the end was near for Gaddafi . \n`` These really seem to be last , desperate acts . \nIf you 're bombing your own capital , it 's really hard to see how you can survive , '' its Middle East analyst Julien Barnes-Dacey said . \nThe demonstrations spread to Tripoli , on the Mediterranean Sea , after several cities in the east , including Benghazi , appeared to fall to the opposition , according to residents . \nHuman Rights Watch said at least 233 people had been killed in five days of violence , but opposition groups put the figure much higher . \nA coalition of Libyan Muslim leaders told all Muslims it was their duty to rebel against the Libyan leadership because of its `` bloody crimes against humanity . '' \nThe building where the General People 's Congress , or parliament , meets in Tripoli was on fire on Monday , as was a police station in an eastern suburb , witnesses said . \nAl Jazeera television quoted medical sources as saying 61 people had been killed in the latest protests in Tripoli . \nIt said security forces were looting banks and other government institutions in Tripoli , and protesters had broken into several police stations and ransacked them . \nSaif al-Islam said on Sunday his father would fight the revolt until `` the last man standing .

'' \nMacDonald went on to warn of a tipping point from which the wildlife and ecosystem in the Gulf could not recover . \nMeanwhile , in the Science article , experts from the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institute mapped a 22-mile plume of oil droplets from BP 's well , providing the strongest evidence so far over the fate of the crude . \n`` These results indicate that efforts to book-keep where the oil went must now include this plume , '' said Christopher Reddy , one of the Woods Hole team . \nThe report also said the plume was very slow to break down by natural forces . \n`` Many people speculated that subsurface oil droplets were being easily degraded , '' said Richard Camilli , the lead author of the paper . \n`` Well , we did n't find that . \nWe found it was still there . '' \nThe scientists zig-zagged for hundreds of miles across the ocean to track the plume , taking 57,000 readings of its chemical signature during a 10-day research voyage at the end of June . \nThe Woods Hole effort reinforces earlier reports from research voyages by scientists from the University of Georgia and Texas A&M University who detected the presence of deepwater plumes of oil . \nThis week , University of South Florida scientists reported oil in amounts that were toxic to critical plankton on the ocean floor far east of the spill . \nThose findings have not been reviewed by other scientists . \nAccording to the Woods Hole findings , the deepwater plume is 22 miles long or about the length of Manhattan 1.2 miles wide and 650ft high . \nIt noted that the plume was not made up of pure oil but included toxic oil compounds including benzene and xylene . \nYesterday 's testimony and the Science article put the White House and government scientific agencies increasingly out of step with independent scientists . \nIt also raises new questions about the administration 's decision to use nearly 2m gallons of a chemical dispersant Corexit to break up the oil . \nThe NOAA chief Jane Lubchenco , herself an ocean scientist , had played down the first reports of oil in the ocean depths . \nMacDonald and other scientists have accused NOAA of discouraging them from making public their findings about lingering oil in the deepwater . \nA NOAA spokeswoman said last night that the Woods Hole voyage was in late June , while the broken BP well was still spewing oil . \n`` It 's not necessarily an indication of where we are today '' she said . \nA NOAA team reported two weeks ago that just over a quarter of oil remained in the Gulf as a light sheen on the surface or degraded tar balls washing ashore . \nA version appeared on p19 of the Main section section of the Guardian on 02.00 BST on Friday 20 August 2010 Follow the latest environment news , comment and analysis on Twitter ", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "The BP oil spill has still left three-quarters of the oil in the Gulf environment, despite earlier reports suggesting most of it had been captured or broken down.

LVMH market cap of $ 80 bln By Elzio Barreto , Elisa Anzolin and Gianluca Semeraro HONG KONG\\/MILAN , June 17 -LRB- Reuters -RRB- - Italian fashion house Prada SpA floated at the low end of its target price range on Friday , raising $ 2.1 billion as investors baulked at its rich valuation while global markets are weak . \nThe maker of luxury bags and Miu Miu dresses , which had originally hoped to raise as much as $ 2.6 billion , priced its initial public offering -LRB- IPO -RRB- at HK$ 39.50 a share , three sources with direct knowledge of the deal said on Friday . \nFund managers said that while luxury investors are used to paying more for high-end discretionary brands , Prada had to adapt its initial ambition due to market volatility . \nA poor Hong Kong debut by luggage brand Samsonite International on Thursday augured ill for Prada 's offering , the biggest on the exchange so far this year . \n`` Luxury demand is very self explanatory , and it makes a lot of sense for companies like Samsonite and Prada to list in Hong Kong , but we 're talking about quite a volatile market , '' said Selina Sia , head of consumer research at Mirae Asset . \nPrada had set an indicative price range of HK$ 36.5 to HK$ 48 per share , before narrowing it to between HK$ 39.50 and HK$ 42.25 a share on Thursday . \nAt the top of its original range , Prada would trade at 27 times projected 2011 earnings , far higher than an average of 20.4 times for luxury retailers such as LVMH and Hermes International SCA , according to Phillip Securities ' forecasts . \nAt the revised guidance Prada would trade at a P\\/E of 22.8-24 .4 times , more in line with global rivals . \nPrada and shareholders Prada Holding BV and Intesa Sanpaolo sold 423.3 million shares in the offering , raising HK$ 16.72 billion -LRB- $ 2.14 billion -RRB- , said the sources . \nThe IPO valued Prada at about $ 13 billion , compared with the nearly $ 80 billion market capitalization of LVMH , $ 28.5 billion for Hermes and $ 21 billion for PPR SA . \nPrada , set up in 1913 by Mario Prada as a business selling leather bags , trunks and silverware to the European elite , has become a global fashion empire , with 319 directly operated stores , a third of which are in Asia Pacific . \nThe move by retailers such as Prada to list in Hong Kong is part of a trend to raise brand awareness in China . \nAs part of the marketing for its offering , Prada hosted a fashion show for top fund managers , who jostled for space at the glitzy Grand Hyatt Hotel in Hong Kong to see Miuccia Prada 's creations and hear about China 's booming demand for luxury goods . \nChina 's consumption of luxury goods is forecast to grow 18 percent annually to about $ 27.5 billion by 2015 , from about $ 12.2 billion in 2010 , according to consultancy McKinsey . \nBut some investors were concerned that Prada 's growth targets -- it expects sales to rise more than 20 percent over the next three years if the global economy continues to improve -- were too ambitious . \n`` Prada is a very strong brand , but it has an aggressive growth strategy which looks more difficult to achieve in the current economic environment , '' said Scilla Huang Sun , who runs a luxury fund for Swiss and Global Asset management . \nDespite volatile markets casting a cloud over Prada 's offering , it was nevertheless nearly three times oversubscribed at the listing price , one source said . \nMarket uncertainty , which has also hit new listings in Europe this year , with more than 15 deals pulled and others performing poorly after their flotations , is expected to continue to affect offerings in Hong Kong in the short term . \n`` The market is going through a very difficult phase , '' said Philippe Espinasse , a former investment banker with Nomura and UBS in Hong Kong and author of `` IPO : a Global Guide '' . \nThe benchmark Hang Seng Index has declined in 11 of the last 12 sessions , losing 7.6 percent , and world stocks hit a three-month low on Thursday , weighing on investor demand for new issues . \nOf the larger IPOs in Asia this year , only MGM China has posted a first-day gain . \nPrada 's listing was organised by Goldman Sachs , Credit Agricole 's CLSA brokerage and Italian banks UniCredit SpA and Intesa Sanpaolo 's Banca IMI unit , which are both represented on Prada 's board . \n-LRB- $ 1 = 7.801 Hong Kong Dollars -RRB- -LRB- Additional reporting by Antonella Ciancio , Astrid Wendlandt , Kylie MacLellan ;

It 's a story which has involved our reporters in Mexico , the US , Europe , Scotland and the rest of the UK , plus our medical and science specialists . And it has challenged us to think hard about our public service role on this kind of news story . In order to see this content you need to have both Javascript enabled and Flash installed . Visit BBC Webwise for full instructions . If you 're reading via RSS , you 'll need to visit the blog to access this content . Essentially , our task is to give you the facts ; to tell you what we know , but also explore what is n't known ; to give you the best scientific and medical information and to inform but not to alarm . There is a great deal of coverage in all the media which has led to a debate about whether the threat is being overplayed . With any public health story , there 's a risk that raising awareness can raise concern . We have sought at every step to report the science soberly and responsibly , with due weight given to the uncertainty of what will happen . We know that audiences have many questions . For the first couple of days , the comments and questions were coming in thick and fast , though they have now slowed . The majority has been from the UK , but there are considerable numbers from Europe and the US too . Yesterday , BBC Radio 5 Live did a phone-in , taking listeners ' questions about the outbreak 's impact and attempting to answer them using medical and travel experts . Those contacting the network had a range of questions : `` My son 's an hour and a half from Mexico City - how exposed is he ? '' `` Are anti-viral drugs safe for pregnant women ? '' `` I 'm booked to go to Mexico on 30 April ; the airline wo n't let us cancel and get a refund , what are our options ? '' To satisfy those members of our audience who 've been contacting our programs and website with questions , we put together a comprehensive Q&A . In our current Have Your Say debate on the subject , many contributors have now said they believe that the government and media are over-reacting . And World Have Your Say - the World Service global discussion program - was presented from the rooftop of a hotel in Mexico City yesterday . It asked its audience if the world was over-reacting to swine flu . We heard from many , including Abdullah in Abuja who e-mailed to say that there really was no comparison between swine flu and the kind of diseases many African nations deal with on a daily basis . There are voices raising important questions about media coverage of this virus . Ben Goldacre - a medical doctor who writes the Bad Science blog - says that he 's been struck by the number of people contacting him to say `` Is swine flu just nonsense ? '' and that the media is `` utterly '' mistrusted on its reporting of health issues . Simon Jenkins , writing today in the Guardian , has said the media has whipped up a panic in order to posture and spend . So far , the balance we have been trying to achieve is to report what we know and , critically , what is n't known , using the science available - for instance from the Chief Medical Officer for England , Sir Liam Donaldson and the World Health Organization - as well as what respected scientists are telling us about the possible pattern of this illness . At our editorial meetings , we have been regularly discussing how to get the approach , tone and use of pictures right , and to make sure that we offer our expertise and subject depth via our website . Interestingly , the signs so far suggest that the public is not panicking - listeners contacting BBC Radio 1 's Newsbeat are showing a distinct shift in opinion . Two days ago , they were expressing serious concern , but now - for many - it 's receding : `` Swine Flu has changed what I 'm doing . I yawned at the last radio update . I 'd probably not have done that if Swine Flu was n't mentioned . '' This virus - and this story - may fade away , or it may grow . At this point , as our correspondents are saying , we simply do n't know . I hope that our reporting in the past few days will help you make sense of what emerges in the next few days , whichever way it develops .

NEW : Armed Services chairman says the mission is to allow the Libyan people to oust Gadhafi NEW : GOP Sen. Lugar says the use of military force should have been debated Gates says the goal is to increase pressure for Gadhafi 's ouster No evidence so far of missile strikes killing civilians , Gates says Washington -LRB- CNN -RRB- -- Presidential leadership or kowtowing to allies ? Abuse of power or decisive action in the face of imminent catastrophe ? Supporters and critics used Sunday talk shows to debate President Barack Obama 's Libya policy on Sunday , the day before the president addresses the nation on the issue . The speech Monday night follows calls from all quarters for Obama to clarify the reason he sent U.S. forces to head the U.N.-authorized military mission intended to prevent Libyan leader Moammar Gadhafi from unleashing his military on his own people . Obama has said that U.S. policy is the ouster of Gadhafi . However , the mandate of the military coalition is only to enforce a no-fly zone and arms embargo in Libya while taking other necessary steps to protect civilians . Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan , chairman of the Armed Services Committee , explained on CNN 's `` State of the Union '' that the mission 's goal is to give the Libyan people the political freedom to oust Gadhafi . `` We 're part of an international coalition , which has been supported now by U.N. resolution with the support of Arab countries , to prevent the slaughter of civilians in Libya , '' Levin said , adding : `` It 's going to take the people of Libya to remove their dictator with the help of economic sanctions that the world has put in place . '' Meanwhile , two senior Cabinet members -- Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Defense Secretary Robert Gates -- appeared on three programs in interviews conducted Saturday to also make the case for the Obama policy . Woman alleges Libyan forces raped her NATO 's role in Libya unclear `` There is no perfect option when one is looking at a situation like this , '' Clinton said on the ABC program `` This Week . '' `` I think that the president ordered the best available option . The United States worked with the international community to make sure that there was authorization to do what we have helped to accomplish . '' Both Clinton and Levin emphasized that the international support was essential to avoid any perception or accusation that the United States -- already engaged in wars in Iraq and Afghanistan -- was unilaterally committing military forces in a third Muslim country . `` The secret to success is a coalition , '' Levin told CNN , advocating an `` international decision where a unilateral decision could have significant downsides . '' Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich , who is expected to announce his candidacy soon for the Republican presidential nomination , challenged such an approach , telling `` Fox News Sunday '' he wants Obama 's speech to be `` dramatically clearer than he has been up until now . '' `` I hope the president will say , first of all he is consulting the U.S. Congress , not just the Arab League and United Nations , '' Gingrich said . `` I hope he will say second that it 's clear that the Gadhafi dictatorship has to leave , and that we are prepared to do whatever it takes to make sure the Gadhafi dictatorship leaves . '' Despite his tough rhetoric , Gingrich made clear he opposes sending any U.S. ground troops to Libya -- a position also held by Obama . `` Once you engage air power , you should use the air power in its most effective way , '' Gingrich said . `` You do n't need to send in ground forces . '' Sen. Richard Lugar of Indiana , the ranking Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee , criticized a lack of congressional debate before Obama committed military forces to the Libyan mission . `` There should have been a plan as to what our objectives were , a debate , before we committed armed resources , '' Lugar told the NBC program `` Meet the Press , '' later adding : `` I do n't believe we should be engaged in the Libyan civil war . I think the Libyans are going to have to work that out . '' Obama has said the U.S. role in the Libyan mission will diminish once NATO takes over control and command , which could start happening as soon as Monday . However , Gates made clear that even in a diminished role , U.S. forces will still be involved in the mission as long as it continues . `` As long as there is a no-fly zone and we have some unique capabilities to bring to bear -- for example , intelligence , surveillance and reconnaissance , some tanking aviation -- we will continue to have a presence , '' he said on ABC . So far , he said , the military mission was proceeding well . `` I would say , for all practical purposes , the implementation of the no-fly zone is complete , '' Gates said . `` Now it will need to be sustained , but it can be sustained with a lot less effort than what it took to set it up . '' Asked if there was a problem between the military mission 's limited goal of civilian protection and Obama 's stated policy objective of ousting Gadhafi , both Gates and Clinton said no. `` You do n't , in a military campaign , set as a mission or a goal something you are not sure you can achieve , '' Gates told the CBS program `` Face the Nation . '' `` And as we 've learned over the past number of years , regime change is very complicated and can be very expensive and can take a long time . So I think the key here was establishing a military mission that was achievable , was achievable in a limited period of time and could be sustained . '' On the same program , Clinton noted how former Serbian leader Slobodan Milosevic remained in power despite mounting internal and external pressure for his ouster that ended with Milosevic dying while on trial in the international war crimes court . She likened that situation to Gadhafi today . `` It took a while for Milosevic to leave , but you could see his days were numbered even though he was n't yet out of office , '' Clinton said . Gates joked on CBS that he `` would n't be hanging any new pictures '' if he were Gadhafi , then noted that there are several possible scenarios for the Libyan leader 's ouster . `` His military can turn , we could see elements of his military turning , deciding this is a no-win proposition , the families splitting , I mean any number of possibilities are out there , particularly as long as the international pressure continues , and those around him see no future in staying with him , '' Gates said . On the same program , Gates also said that Gadhafi is placing bodies of people his regime has killed at the sites of some missile strikes by the U.S.-led coalition . Gadhafi has claimed that coalition missile attacks have killed civilians , and some NATO members and Arab nations responded with concern that the Libyan military mission might exceed the intent of the U.N. Security Council resolution that authorized it . `` The truth of the matter is we have trouble coming up with proof of any civilian casualties that we have been responsible for , '' Gates told CBS . `` But we do have a lot of intelligence reporting about Gadhafi taking the bodies of the people he 's killed and putting them at the sites where we 've attacked . '' Asked how often it has happened , Gates replied : `` We have a number of reports of that . '' A senior defense official told CNN on Sunday that the U.S. military has information gleaned from intelligence sources that Gadhafi has tasked his aides to search morgues and hospitals for dead bodies to be posed as civilian casualties .

And rushing to the aid of the Libyan rebels trying to overthrow Gadhafi would be played up on the Arab street as the United States again interfering in a Muslim nation 's internal affairs . On the other hand , it 's in our national DNA to want to come to the aid of people who are struggling to gain their freedom . Plus there is all that oil , of course , but that 's a much more cynical view . People are laying down their lives trying to get out from under the yoke of arguably one of the world 's most brutal dictators . We have the military wherewithal to make their struggle a lot easier , but so far we have n't done that . Here s my question to you : When it comes to Libya , what s the right thing for the U.S. to do ? Interested to know which ones made it on air ? Kent in New Castle , Indiana : I sympathize greatly with the Libyan people trying to gain freedom , but I strongly feel we have to learn that we can not direct the destiny of every country in turmoil . I think we should let them solve their own problems unless a strong majority in the UN supports intervention . The U.S. should not carry the burden of the efforts . The U.S. should definitely maintain a humanitarian effort but we need to keep our troops out . It 's not our fight and by stepping in , we take the news away from the Libyan people and suddenly it 's our story . I 'm afraid history will be critical of our inaction . No , we should n't send troops , however , we should supply small arms , a no fly zone , food and medical supplies . If we believe in freedom of the people we should help the people and make a better name for ourselves in the region . We help every one else , why not them ? The right thing is to create and enforce a No Fly Zone in Libya . It can be done quickly and effectively with the forces already in the area . It effectively evens the field and will quicken Gadhafi 's departure as the Military will have more defections as they see their major advantage go away . The key for us with the Muslim world is to immediately withdraw the strategy when the fight is settled . Stay offshore , off the holy land and leave when it 's done . If we do not stand for freedom , then why have so many Americans died in Europe , Korea , Vietnam , and the Middle East ? Is our government s decision to fight for freedom based on oil , money , or a principle ? I think that the biggest problem in this country is that America thinks about the problems of other countries before our own . What will it take for the ruling powers in our own country to put the U.S. , first ? This nation has enough problems already that we need to deal with now . The right thing to do is give the protesters weapons and leave American troops out of it . March 8 , 2011 at 5:41 pm | The Lybian people have to win their own revolution . We should help with humanitarian aid , keep the media on Ghadaffi as protection of his people , and agree to abide by whatever the united nations decides to do . March 8 , 2011 at 5:49 pm | I wonder what Reagan would do ? We know what he would have done because he did it before . And , as a result we got a look at Gadhafi 's true character . No I think a coward is more fitting . I believe we take out his air defense , gun ships and send a cruse into his tent , and he 'll be gone . We then work with and support the new government . Other arab nations are nervous about us not supporting them , but they are more worried that the US has no stomach for standing up to what it supports . Bush put these governments on notice with the Freedom Agenda . Now we need to `` walk the talk '' . March 8 , 2011 at 5:53 pm | The US should participate in a plan agreed upon by the leaders of the world -- no more , no less . March 8 , 2011 at 5:57 pm | Stay out of it . Let the Arab nation fix there own problems . March 8 , 2011 at 5:58 pm | A no fly zone looks simple on paper ; however , in reality it means war on Libya . I recommend the US does not do anything until there is genocide of Libyan people in which the US should support the UN and all countries of Europe presenting a `` United Front '' That will give Qaddafi a clear message that the world will not tolerate his behaviors March 8 , 2011 at 5:59 pm | I think it 's very important that we do what we can remotely , by enforcing a no-fly zone and arming the rebels , without direct military engagement on the ground . We need to help level the playing field , but understand and respect the attitudes there about us . March 8 , 2011 at 6:00 pm | The right thing to do is stay out of it . Like you said , if we help , we create a bad reputation both for ourselves and for the Libyan opposition groups . No one will appreciate what we do , no matter what . And it 's not clear that the Libyan opposition wants a secular democracy anyway ... we 'd really look foolish if we spent the time , effort , money , and possibly lives to pave the way for a Hamas or Muslim Brotherhood kind of group to take over the country . March 8 , 2011 at 6:02 pm | We lost 68000 boys in Vietnam , for what ? We went into Iraq for What ? We armed the Afghans and called them freedom feighters against the Russians and now we call them insurgents . Let make war unprofitable and we will make them inpossible . To have our boys come back in boxes for Libya . -- Libya March 8 , 2011 at 6:04 pm | We have the military wherewithal to make their struggle a lot easier ? We still have n't managed to win in or extricate ourselves from Iraq or Afghanistan . What in the world makes you think we could get it right in Libya ? Get a clue , Jack . The right thing , indeed the ONLY thing for us to do with Libya is stay the Hell away and let the Libyans sort it out for themselves . We should declare was on the sucker like we should have during the bombing of our comercial airlines . It is high past time that we side on the people who oppose oppression . We need to stand on the side that is morally right for a change , not just the politically expedient . March 8 , 2011 at 6:10 pm | America is crumbling under a huge debt contracted with China to fuel 2 wars that are still going on , killed millions of Iraqis , Afgans , and our soldiers , maimed as many and displaced many more . We are fighting healhcare , cutting education , cutting social security budgets to our children , elderly and handicaps . . So we do n't have money for our people and we have money for another war ? . Do we really want another war on our hands ? March 8 , 2011 at 6:10 pm | help them , we help every one else , why not them March 8 , 2011 at 6:11 pm | No matter what we do , people will think it is wrong . March 8 , 2011 at 6:11 pm | Simple ! The U.S. has watched and worst still , aided Israel indulge in a genocide against the Palestinian People for 62 years .

At the very least , as Frank James blogs for Tribune , Obama oversold what Timothy Geithner ended up delivering . At his Monday night press conference , Obama said Geithner would `` be announcing some very clear and specific plans for how we are going to start loosening up credit once again ... It means that we correct some of the mistakes with TARP that were made earlier , the lack of consistency , the lack of clarity in terms of how the program was going to move forward . '' But as David Cho and Lori Montgomery write in The Washington Post , `` the lack of detail in -LRB- Geithner 's -RRB- plan dismayed lawmakers and investors , triggering a steep sell-off on Wall Street ... `` The Treasury Department provided only the most general descriptions of how struggling homeowners and small businesses would be helped . And officials said they have yet to design a program that is a core part of the plan : A public-private initiative that would encourage investors to buy up the toxic assets now weighing down the books of banks and threatening to overwhelm the firms with losses . `` Cleansing the financial system of these assets , which are backed by failing mortgages and other troubled loans , has vexed officials since Congress approved the $ 700 billion rescue package in October . `` Geithner , who is in charge of overseeing the government 's response to the financial crisis , said yesterday that the government has been too slow to respond to the crisis . ` Policy was always behind the curve , always chasing the escalating crisis , ' Geithner said , criticizing his predecessor , Henry M. Paulson Jr. ` The emergency actions meant to provide confidence and reassurance too often added to public anxiety and to investor uncertainty . ' `` But yesterday , Geithner seemed to be following the Hank Paulson playbook , according to a wide consensus on Wall Street , in Washington , and beyond . '' In Geithner 's defense , he 's trying to solve an enormously complicated problem in a challenging political environment . Jim Puzzanghera and Maura Reynolds write in the Los Angeles Times about the `` double bind for the Obama administration . `` Fixing the financial system has turned out to be a bigger , harder and much more expensive challenge than expected , potentially requiring billions more in additional federal commitments . `` But the political climate has turned so sour that Congress , enraged by what it sees as irresponsible excesses by Wall Street executives , is unlikely to approve more funding , at least for now . `` As a result , the administration is moving toward approaches that reduce the government 's financial risk and require no new congressional action . But those constraints mean the plans are taking longer to design and implement . '' Deborah Solomon writes in the Wall Street Journal : `` A senior Treasury official said the administration explored ` quite a few alternatives ' but concluded it was a ` challenge ' to have the government set a price for the bad assets . Instead , they believe their structure will allow the private sector to value them . '' In his interview with ABC News 's Terry Moran yesterday , Obama did n't seem overly troubled at Wall Street 's negative reaction to the Geithner plan . `` Well , you know , Wall Street , I think , is hoping for an easy out on this thing and there is no easy out . Essentially , what you 've got are a set a banks that have not been as transparent as we need to be in terms of what their books look like , '' Obama said . `` And we 're going to have to hold out the Band-Aid a little bit and go ahead and just be clear about some of the losses that have been made because until we do that , we 're not going to be able to attract private capital into the marketplace . And so , you know , I think that you have two choices in this situation : You can prolong the agony and shareholders will be happy until they 're not happy , and that could be a year from now or two years from now , or , in the case of Japan , eight years later . `` Or you can just go ahead and acknowledge that , yeah , there 's a lot of work that has to be done to put these banks back on a firmer footing . '' Obama also explained why he thinks nationalizing banks -- the increasingly preferred solution of many left-leaning economists -- would n't make sense . Moran : `` There are a lot of economists who look at these banks and they say all that garbage that 's in them renders them essentially insolvent . Why not just nationalize the banks ? '' Obama : `` Well , you know , it 's interesting . There are two countries who have gone through some big financial crises over the last decade or two . One was Japan , which never really acknowledged the scale and magnitude of the problems in their banking system and that resulted in what 's called ` The Lost Decade . ' They kept on trying to paper over the problems . The markets sort of stayed up because the Japanese government kept on pumping money in . But , eventually , nothing happened and they didn `` t see any growth whatsoever . `` Sweden , on the other hand , had a problem like this . They took over the banks , nationalized them , got rid of the bad assets , resold the banks and , a couple years later , they were going again . So you 'd think looking at it , Sweden looks like a good model . Here 's the problem ; Sweden had like five banks . -LRB- He laughs . -RRB- We 've got thousands of banks . You know , the scale of the U.S. economy and the capital markets are so vast and the problems in terms of managing and overseeing anything of that scale , I think , would -- our assessment was that it wouldn `` t make sense . And we also have different traditions in this country . '' New York Times columnist Paul Krugman responds in his blog : `` Yes , we have thousands of banks but the problems are concentrated in a handful of big players . In fact , the Geithner plan , such as it is , already acknowledges this : the ` stress test ' is to be applied only to banks with assets over $ 100 billion , of which there are supposed to be around 14 . `` And the argument that our culture won t stand for nationalization well , our culture isn t too friendly towards bank bailouts of any kind . Yet those bailouts are necessary ; and even in America they may be more palatable if taxpayers at least get to throw the bums out . `` Oh , and not a week goes by without the FDIC taking several smaller banks into receivership .

Arriving at Beijing 's airport right now is a bit like turning up at a laboratory . I 've just come back to Beijing following a few days in the UK . As our flight came in to land , the cabin crew handed out H1N1 health forms issued by China . These forms asked us to list our seat number and our contact numbers in Beijing . We also had to answer the question : `` Have you had close contact with pigs within the past week ? '' When we landed , we were told to stay in our seats . A team of Chinese health inspectors wearing masks then boarded the plane . The inspectors proceeded slowly down each row , pointing what I can only describe as a temperature gun at each passenger 's forehead -LRB- we made their jobs easier by politely tilting our foreheads to the inspectors as they went by -RRB- . A few minutes later , the inspectors escorted one passenger in an orange t-shirt off the plane . He looked pretty embarrassed . Inside the airport terminal , we passed through a further two checkpoints staffed by guards checking for anyone with a fever . Leaflets warned us : `` It is the responsibility of every citizen to self-monitor at home for seven days after coming back from abroad . '' In case that man with the orange t-shirt is diagnosed with H1N1 , the Health Ministry has enough information to track us all down and put us all into quarantine for a week . This report is objective , good work James ! And , thank you for being polite and cooperative in the inspection process . Wish the flu can come to an end soon . So this is pretty much an admission from the CCP that SARS was handled appalingly .

My employers frequently complain that the commuters in our office are ill - I think the reason is obvious ! Just on Wednesday I saw something that made me laugh : A young lady wearing a face mask . I thought to myself `` At last ! A responsible fellow citizen ! '' But no , a few moments later she slipped off the face mask , sneezed violently into the air and slipped the mask back over her mouth and nose .

It has become fashionable to fret that the current crisis on Wall Street marks the end of American capitalism as we know it . `` This massive bailout is not the solution , '' Sen. Jim Bunning -LRB- R-Ky . -RRB- `` It is financial socialism , and it is un-American . '' The near-collapse of the U.S. financial system and Washington 's sudden and massive intervention to try to shore it up certainly mark a major turning point , but a bailout would represent a thoroughly American next step for our economic system -- and one that will probably lead to better times . Americans may assume that the basics of capitalism have been firmly established here since time immemorial , but historical cataclysms such as the Great Depression strongly suggest otherwise . Simply put , capitalism evolves . And we need to understand its trajectory if we are to bring our economic system into greater accord with the other great source of American strength : the best principles of our democracy . No , our economy is not a shining example of pure unfettered market forces . It never has been . In his farewell address back in 1796 , 20 years after the publication of Adam Smith 's `` The Wealth of Nations , '' George Washington defined the new republic 's own distinctive national economic sensibility : `` Our commercial policy should hold an equal and impartial hand ; neither seeking nor granting exclusive favors or preferences ; consulting the natural course of things ; diffusing and diversifying by gentle means the streams of commerce , but forcing nothing . '' From the outset , Washington envisioned some government involvement in the commercial system , even as he recognized that commerce should belong to the people . Capitalism is not really the best word to describe this arrangement . -LRB- The term was coined in the late 19th century as a way to describe the ideological opposite of communism . -RRB- Some decades later , people began to use a better term , `` the American system , '' in which the government involved itself in the economy primarily to develop what we would now call infrastructure -- highways , canals , railroads -- but otherwise let economic liberty prevail . I prefer to call this spectacularly successful arrangement `` financial democracy '' -- a largely free system in which the U.S. government 's role is to help citizens achieve their best potential , using all the economic weapons that our financial arsenal can provide . So is the government 's bailout a major departure ? Today 's federal involvement offers bailouts as a strictly temporary measure to prevent a system-wide financial calamity . This is entirely in keeping with our basic principles -- as long as the bailout promotes , rather than hinders , financial democracy . Which , so far , it seems to . Congressional critics may be right to demand more help for homeowners and more accountability for Wall Street blunders , but the core idea of the plan is sound : to protect the financial infrastructure . Remember , Fannie Mae used to be a government entity , and by taking it over , the federal government is merely returning to the status quo ante . The measures to take toxic debts off the hands of financial and insurance firms are intended only to deal with a crisis , not to transform our financial system . The proposals do not represent any landmark change in the American way of prosperity . Everyone should take a deep breath . Changing our thinking about finance does not mean abolishing capitalism , but it does raise questions about what the changes mean . Whenever the public endures a crisis , ordinary citizens start to wonder how -- and whether -- our institutions really work . We no longer take things for granted . It is only then that real change becomes possible . So the current crisis got me thinking back to 1990 , the year before the collapse of the Soviet Union , when I worked with two Soviet economists , Maxim Boycko and Vladimir Korobov , to try to understand the different belief systems in their country and mine . We carried out identical surveys in Moscow and New York , comparing answers about fundamental notions of capitalism , and published our results in the American Economic Review . We expected to find that the Muscovites possessed scant understanding of how capitalism really works . But we found that they actually understood free-market dynamics better than the New Yorkers . We concluded that the Muscovites had proved more savvy precisely because their system was in crisis -- something that encouraged them to rethink their most fundamental notions . We Americans are going through a similar change right now . We no longer think that our financial future will be determined by securities brokers or inhumanly large investment banks . The most important question is not , `` What form should these temporary bailouts take ? '' It is , `` What are we really learning from all this ? '' We should be learning a great deal . The current crisis offers us a singular opportunity to reevaluate fundamentally the safety and permanence of the master financial institutions that we have come to take for granted as part of the national economic landscape . Over these past few turbulent weeks , we have learned that the monolithic investment banks are mortal : They are mostly gone , or absorbed by other banks . We have learned that what we called `` cash '' and considered perfectly safe is not necessarily so secure . So we are groping around for something else to trust . We should be open to thinking about a new set of financial arrangements -- a better financial democracy -- that can restore the public 's faith in the economic principles espoused by Washington more than two centuries ago . Here are some key features : 1 . Handle moral hazard better . The term `` moral hazard '' refers to the pernicious tendency some people have of failing deliberately if they think it 's advantageous to do so . Moral hazard is used to justify teaching people a lesson for their failures -- the same logic that once justified `` debtors ' prisons . '' -LRB- Yes , we really did have them . -RRB- But over the course of the 19th century , Americans grew more realistic about laying blame for economic catastrophes and started eyeing other parties besides the hapless and the bankrupt . The demise of the debtors ' prisons reflected Americans ' changing ideas about the meaning of a contract . By rescuing Wall Street tycoons who succumbed to the lure of an irrationally exuberant housing bubble , the bailouts today do pose something of a moral-hazard problem . But we can more than repair it by defining a new generation of financial contracts , with a continuation of our evolving thinking about moral hazard , reflecting greater enlightenment , greater understanding of human psychology and the means to deal with financial failure . For example , I have proposed replacing the conventional mortgage with what I call the `` continuous-workout mortgage '' -- one that would spell out in advance the conditions under which borrowers would see their debt reduced in a rocky economy . These conditions would be designed to minimize moral hazard : The borrowers would not be able to make the debt reduction happen deliberately . To limit risks to the system , build better derivatives . Some of today 's derivatives -- the complex bundles of toxic real estate loans that helped drag Lehman Brothers down -- turned out to be `` financial weapons of mass destruction , '' as the legendary investor Warren E. Buffett warned back in 2003 . The problem is n't derivatives per se but a certain kind -- derivatives that spun a massive web of over-the-counter contracts , relying on the solvency of countless banks and other institutions , and ultimately endangered the entire financial system when they fell apart . Some kinds of derivatives , such as those maintained by futures exchanges using procedures that effectively eliminate the risk that the other party in the agreement will default , are more useful -- and far safer -- than others . It is high time to redesign derivatives to avoid what Buffett called `` mega-catastrophic '' risks . Trust markets , not Wall Street titans . If institutions can be said to have charisma , such giants as Lehman Brothers and Merrill Lynch certainly had it in spades . But these firms proved not to be the sole source of financial intelligence . They were merely meeting places for smart ,", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "The government's involvement in the economy is as old as the republic itself.

Case studies are all well and good , but the presidential group 's reports of what went wrong with the decision making amid the government 's response read like one of the most instructive business case studies I 've seen in a long time . The working papers , released Oct. 6 , reveal a poorly managed response , a delay of the release of information about the spill 's worst-case scenario , and confusion about the severity of the spill . They offer a rare comprehensive look at decision-making in a crisis that is immediate , highly detailed and even harsh in its assessment . The average case study is none of those things . Among the findings of the commission : agencies differed over how to describe the spill publicly as its immensity became better understood ; studying the fate of the spilled oil was not `` peer reviewed , '' as some officials had stated ; and a `` lack of regulatory guidance '' contributed to the confusion . But it is the decision-making problems that will resonate most with leaders , no matter whether they lead a corporate office , a government agency or a non-profit organization . The `` Decision-Making Within the Unified Command '' report places significant blame on a circumvented command structure , in which `` inter-agency groups were activated but later marginalized '' while top agency chiefs , who were often political appointees , `` remained very involved in the response and took over addressing key issues . '' While that might have helped with image management , the report notes , it injected politics where it was n't needed . `` Such involvement may have increased accountability , and helped to make controversial decision-making more transparent , but it also made the decisions more subject to criticism and delay on political grounds , '' the report notes . Likewise , the established response teams became , as the working papers call them , `` report-to '' bodies rather than `` decision-making '' teams . That bypass of the traditional structure made it confusing to the public and to responders where authority lay . In the flap over using dispersants to clear the oil , for instance , political appointees who had not been part of earlier analyses were suddenly making decisions despite a lack of knowledge . In other words , the government suffered from the classic traps of micro-management and too much centralization . As the report states , `` much of the unified command structure is designed to push issues down to the most local level at which they can be addressed . Having strong agency head participation tended to elevate decisions that might have otherwise been addressed closer to the source of the question , '' where , presumably , the amount of knowledge was greater . A weakened presidency , heightened national political tensions and the magnitude of the spill all contributed to decision-making meddling from higher-ups . But any organization in crisis often faces the same risk : top executives want to look like they 're taking swift action , when really the best course might be simply letting go . The temptation for leaders to wade in -- no pun intended -- and micro-manage during a crisis blurs decision-making structures , confuses front-line workers and slows down action as everyone waits to see what the higher-ups want now that the traditional process has been shattered . In a crisis , leaders would be wise to remember that the best way to burnish their image as a take-action chief is to get the crisis solved . And that usually means stepping back and letting people do their jobs . Please email us to report offensive comments . As dismal as all of this is , it seems to me it REALLY operates -LRB- whether `` wittingly '' or not makes no real difference -RRB- as a diversionary deflection of attention AWAY from what is perhaps the GREATEST actual damage of the whole fiasco -- which is all the METHANE released into the environment as a consequence of the gusher that took three months to finally cap . The `` whole ` nother dimension '' of this spill that DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE BEEN PICKED UP ON IN THE GENERAL POPULAR CONSCIOUSNESS -- and I m afraid that IT SURELY OUGHT TO BE . I refer to all the METHANE that PRESSURIZED the flow of this gusher to the extent of having DRIVEN that whole spill of 4.9 million barrels of oil . I have heard one figure stated that 40 % of that was methane -LRB- and no , I don t know whether that was by weight or by volume -- or whether at those pressures and temperatures it even makes any difference -RRB- . I point out to people that methane -LRB- CH4 -RRB- is a VERY `` EFFICACIOUS '' GREENHOUSE GAS ! -LRB- meaning , of course , that IT TOO , just like the CO2 about which many folks now generally understand , operates like a `` blanket '' that `` holds in '' the energy of electromagnetic radiation from the Sun , photons of which EASILY PASS THROUGH the atmosphere COMING IN , but then interact with the atoms of the Earth that they eventually strike and end up driving rebound re-radiation of LOWER FREQUENCY photons of INFRA-RED energy . To THESE , such gases are OPAQUE , so that the resulting `` heat '' energy CAN NOT THEN RE-RADIATE FREELY BACK OFF OUT INTO SPACE -- so it `` PILES UP '' , and THE EARTH GETS HOTTER ! -RRB- But CO2 is NOT THE ONLY such `` greenhouse gas '' ; METHANE is evidently MUCH WORSE than CO2 ! Furthermore , lest people imagine that it too -LRB- like the OIL -RRB- has been dispersed into the water , BE ADVISED : METHANE IS NOT WATER-SOLUBLE ! Presumably however much of it has been released I WOULD THINK MUST HAVE BUBBLED UP THROUGH THE WATER AND , except for perhaps 10 % or so of everything that was burned off , MUST HAVE NOW GONE OFF INTO THE AIR !! `` We '' LONG ago already realized that this stuff -LRB- being FLAMMABLE , and indeed EXPLOSIVE -RRB- needed to be `` disposed of '' . And years ago one would see FLARES burning in the vicinity of oil refineries -- which at least served to `` convert '' methane into carbon dioxide , which IS NOT flammable and explosive . We do n't do THAT any longer -LRB- at least not on LAND , in `` developed '' countries -RRB- ; rather `` we '' CAPTURE the stuff . -LRB- It is USEFUL AS A FUEL ! -RRB- And indeed , nowadays every lousy LANDFILL is outfitted with a system of gas-collection wells to CAPTURE the methane that is inevitably given off in the course of the decomposition of complex organic material . -LRB- I have seen one figure suggesting that where methane IS FLARED to CO2 the relative benefit vis - - vis the greenhouse effect is as much as 96 % . So do the math ! With respect to computation of a tons of CO2 emitted EQUIVALENT , the efficacy ratio MUST BE ABOUT 25 TO 1 !! -RRB- But EVIDENTLY NOBODY EVEN BOTHERS TO THINK ABOUT THAT ! BP originated in 1908 as the Anglo-Persian Oil Company a British corporation whose name was changed to the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company . With exclusive rights to extract , refine , export , and sell Iran 's rich oil resources , the company reaped enormous profits . Mohammed Mossadeq , the prime minister signed legislation , to nationalize the Anglo-Iranian Oil Company . The British government was horrified and imposed an economic embargo on Iran . When this failed to bring the Iranians to heel , the British government sought to arrange for the overthrow of Mossadeq . The CIA was placed in charge of an operation , including fomenting riots and other destabilizing activities , to overthrow Mossadeq and advance oil company interests in Iran . Start with the simple truth that the government at every level is not prepared to deal with the sort of event we saw in the Gulf . To have those assets available would have required taxing energy companies and we know how that would have worked : not at all .

Foreign affairs editor Peter Beaumont in Baghdad uncovers a grim trail of abuse carried out by forces loyal to the new Iraqi government Sunday 3 July 2005 02.22 BST The video camera pans across Hassan an-Ni ` ami 's body as it is washed in the mosque for burial . In life he was a slender , good-looking man , usually dressed in a dark robe and white turban , Imam at a mosque in Baghdad 's Adhimiya district and a senior official of the Muslim Clerics Association . When I first interviewed him a year ago he was suspected of contacts with the insurgency . Certainly he supported resistance to US forces . More recently , an-Ni ` ami had dropped out of sight . Then , a little over a month ago , relatives say , paramilitary police commandos from ` Rapid Intrusion ' found him at a family home in the Sha'ab neighborhood of northern Baghdad . His capture was reported on television as that of a senior ` terrorist commander ' . Twelve hours later his body turned up in the morgue . His interrogation and killing were a breach of international law . And it is not only the isolated case of an-Ni ` ami There are police-issue handcuffs still attached to one wrist , from which he was hanged long enough to cause his hands and wrists to swell . There are burn marks on his chest , as if someone has placed something very hot near his right nipple and moved it around . A little lower are a series of horizontal welts , wrapping around his body and breaking the skin as they turn around his chest , as if he had been beaten with something flexible , perhaps a cable . There are other injuries : a broken nose and smaller wounds that look like cigarette burns . An arm appears to have been broken and one of the higher vertebrae is pushed inwards . There is a cluster of small , neat circular wounds on both sides of his left knee . At some stage an-Ni ` ami seems to have been efficiently knee-capped . It was not done with a gun - the exit wounds are identical in size to the entry wounds , which would not happen with a bullet . Instead it appears to have been done with something like a drill . What actually killed him however were the bullets fired into his chest at close range , probably by someone standing over him as he lay on the ground . The last two hit him in the head . The gruesome detail is important . Hanging by the arms in cuffs , scorching of the body with something like an iron and knee-capping are claimed to be increasingly prevalent in the new Iraq . Now evidence is emerging that appears to substantiate those claims . Not only Iraqis make the allegations . International officials describe the methods in disgusted but hushed tones , laying them at the door of the increasingly unaccountable forces attached to Iraq 's Ministry of the Interior . The only question that remains is the level of the co-ordination of the abuse : whether Iraq is stumbling towards a policy of institutionalised torture or whether these are incidents carried out by rogue elements . Six months ago , Human Rights Watch -LRB- HRW -RRB- laid out a catalogue of alleged abuses being applied to those suspected of terrorism in Iraq and called for an independent complaints body in Iraq . But as the insurgency has grown hotter , so too , it appears , have been the methods employed in the dirty counter-insurgency war . To add to HRW 's allegations of beatings , electric shocks , arbitrary arrest , forced confessions and detention without trial , The Observer can add its own charges These include the most brutal kinds of torture , with methods resurrected from the time of Saddam ; of increasingly widespread extra-judicial executions ; and of the existence of a ` ghost ' network of detention facilities - in parallel with those officially acknowledged - that exist beyond all accountability to international human rights monitors , NGOs and even human rights officials of the new Iraqi government . What is most shocking is that it is done under the noses of US and UK officials , some of whom admit that they are aware of the abuses being perpetrated by units who are diverting international funding to their dirty war . Hassan an-Ni ` ami may well have been a terrorist . Or he may have had knowledge of that terrorism . Or he may have been someone who objected too loudly to foreign troops being in Iraq . We will never know . He had no opportunity to defend himself , no lawyer , no trial . His interrogation and killing were a breach of international law . And it is not only the case of an-Ni ` ami but others too , all arrested by units of the Ministry of the Interior , many of whom were tortured and subsequently killed . Post-mortem images show a dozen or so farmers from the insurgent hotbed of Medayeen who were apparently seized by police as they slept in one of Baghdad 's markets and whose bodies were discovered on a rubbish dump in shallow graves to the north of the city . Like an-Ni ` ami , their bodies also bore the marks of extensive torture before execution , most with a bullet to the head . The face of the first body is blackened by strangulation or asphyxiation . Another has bruises to his forehead where he was been hit repeatedly with something heavy . Yet another , his hands still tied with cord , has been punched in the eye and had his ankle fractured . Yet another shows signs of burning similar to an-Ni ` ami 's . The last two have identical puncture wounds , fist-width apart , suggesting the use of a spiked knuckle-duster . Then there is Tahar Mohammed Suleiman al-Mashhadani , seized from the Abu Ghraib neighborhood from early prayers outside a mosque with a number of other men , again by paramilitary police from Rapid Intrusion . When his body was found by family members in the morgue - 20 days after his arrest - he had been tortured almost beyond recognition . These are not isolated cases . For what is extraordinary is the sense of impunity with which the torture , intimidation and murder is taking place . It is not just in Baghdad . In the majority Shia south , far from the worst ravages of the insurgency , there are also emerging reports consistent with the abuses in the capital . If there is a center to this horror , it is Baghdad 's Ministry of the Interior , and the police commando units that operate from there . The ministry is a strange , top-heavy building , set apart in an area of open ground off the highway . Its entrance is guarded by concrete blast-walls and endless checkpoints on the dusty road that leads to its crowded reception . I came here almost exactly a year ago , two days after sovereignty had been handed back to Iraq 's interim government . The floors were occupied by civil servants and blue-uniformed officers of the Iraqi Police Service . It was easy to wander in . These days the ministry is a very different place . The dusty hinterland that leads to it is busy with the new paramilitary forces that most often have been accused of human rights abuses - the Rapid Intrusion brigades , most notoriously the Wolf Brigade of ` Abu Walid ' . There has been no investigation or official findings over the allegations . It was here - 12 months ago - that there was the first intimation that something was going seriously wrong . On the second day of Iraq 's new government , US military police were forced to raid the Guest House to ` rescue ' dozens of alleged criminals , scooped up in a sweep of the city , who were being subjected to beatings and forced confessions of their crimes . Back then officials were happy to justify the violence - and angry at the US intervention . Criminals and terrorists expected a good beating , one official said , proud of his 100 per cent confession rate . Now it is impossible to reach those officials as they shelter on heavily guarded floors . There are no American MPs to come to the aid of those locked in the cells .

RANDI KAYE , CNN ANCHOR : Good morning . A quite morning so far in Tahrir Square , as hundreds gather for Muslim prayers and protesters dig in for Day 13 . In Iran , the trial of three U.S. hikers now under way , all accused of spying and trespassing . And paying tribute to Ronald Reagan . He would have been 100 years old today . Events across the country will honor his life and legacy . We 'll take you there . It 's early and we 're on it . From CNN Center , this is CNN SUNDAY MORNING . It 's February 6 . Good morning , everyone . Glad you 're with us . I 'm Randi Kaye . It 's 6 a.m. on the East Coast and 1 p.m. in Egypt . We want to give a special welcome now to our troops watching us on Armed Forces Network . We start with Egypt , where it 's the start of the workweek . And for the first time in more than a week , some banks in Cairo are open . They had closed at the height of the anti-government protests . The stock market remains closed . Also today , leaders of the Muslim Brotherhood group are expected to meet with Egypt 's new vice president . Brotherhood members originally said they would not talk until President Mubarak was out of office . VP Omar Suleiman met with other opposition leaders yesterday . Suleiman also got a call from his American counterpart , Joe Biden . They talked about the transition and the need for a concrete plan . Biden also set a clear timeline is needed . We 've also seen some high-level shuffling in Egypt 's ruling political party . Several leaders handed in their resignations , including one of President Mubarak 's sons . While some of the banks are reopening in Cairo , life is n't exactly back to normal . Protesters are gathered in the city 's main square for the 13th straight day . CNN 's Ivan Watson joins me live now from Cairo . Ivan , I understand that the Coptic Christians are expected to be gathering in the square today to show their support for the protesters . Have you seen any sign of this ? IVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : That 's right . We saw Muslims and Christians holding hands together upfront at the stage and hold side by side , Randi , a cross and a copy of the Quran in a show of brotherhood here . We 've also just had some evangelical Egyptian Christians playing music on the stage . And that was moments after hundreds of Muslim Christians prayed on the asphalt . And that 's a big deal in a country where just about a month - a little bit more than a month ago , there were some bloody tensions between Muslims and Christians erupting in different parts of the country . Now , we 've heard that one of the main opposition parties , Randi , the Muslim Brotherhood , has said it is willing to sit down now and engaged in a dialogue with the new vice president , Omar Suleiman . Meanwhile , the demonstrations continue here , and there 's a new twist that 's emerged since yesterday : All night last night , some of the demonstrators , scores of them , sat outside the barricades that really protect this enclave here in the heart of Cairo - they sat with campfires making a human chair to prevent the Egyptian military from being able to come in . We saw a standoff earlier yesterday where two tanks were approaching . They are putting their lives on the line , and they do not trust the Egyptian military to come in in large numbers . They say they do not want them to push this demonstration out of Tahrir Square . Take a listen to what one man had to say to us . WATSON : And you can see there , people sitting around - and they 're still doing that now - around an armored personnel carrier . They do not want it to be able to move . Why some of the distrust ? Well , one argument might be that the Egyptian military police is one of the secret police - plainclothes police organizations that has been involved in a number of the tensions of journalists and aid workers and human-right workers around Cairo in recent days . I 've talked to at least four or five people who say they have been detained by the military police . Some of these people saying they 've been blindfolded and handcuffed , taken in for hours of interrogation . And that 's despite the fact that a spokesman for the interior minister recently claimed in a press conference that the military will remain neutral in this standoff between Hosni Mubarak and the demonstrators here in Tahrir Square - Randi . KAYE : All right . Our Ivan Watson for us there in Cairo . And I 'll tell you , take a look at those crowds , and you 'd think after - what ? - Day 13 now , the protesters might be feeling a little bit defeated . But you just look at those crowds , and it seems as though more and more protesters are making their way today to Liberation Square . Ivan , we 'll check back with you later on . Before Egypt erupted , the anti-government protests brought change in Tunisia . But new demonstrations there have now turned deadly . Two people were killed and more than a dozen others were injured when police fired shots into the crowd . Protesters threw rocks and Molotov cocktails at a police station in the northern city of El Kef . Tunisia 's president fled after protests last month . It 's not clear exactly what sparked these new demonstrations . Iraq 's prime minister is n't wasting any time announcing his political intentions . Nouri al-Maliki now says he wo n't run for a third term as Iraq 's leader . He has another three years left in his current term , Al-Maliki also says he 'll back a term-limit amendment to Iraq 's constitution . Time for our `` Weekend Wheel , '' a look at other news you need to know as you get started this Sunday morning . Check out this police stop of a suspected drunk driver in Frankfort , Kentucky . This is from a gas-station surveillance video . That 's Office Brian Redman -LRB- ph -RRB- there in his car . You can see him trying to get the driver to stop . But that 's not exactly happening . The officer was injured . The driver was later found arrested - and he was arrested later on and has a court appearance tomorrow . The officer is recovering at home . Some restaurants in Southern California are being warned that their ground beef could make customers sick . The beef shipped to those restaurants by one California company may be contaminated with E. coli bacteria . We 're talking about 3,000 pounds of hamburger patties and other products . We have n't heard of any reports of people getting sick from that bad beef . Two American hikers are on trial today in Iran for spying and trespassing . Shane Bauer , Josh Fattal and Sarah Shourd were detained in the summer of 2009 after they allegedly strayed across an unmarked border from Iraq into Iran . Shourd was released last fall because of a medical condition . She did not return for the trial . Well , as if I really need to remind you that the Super Bowl is today . The Green Bay Packers and Pittsburgh Steelers will battle it out in Arlington , Texas . For your planning purposes , kickoff is at 6:29 p.m. Eastern time .

Before that , he covered tax and budget policy for The Washington Post and also served as the newspaper 's national business editor . More '' FactCheck.org - Annenberg Public Policy Center of the University of Pennsylvania PolitiFact - St. Petersburg Times and Congressional Quarterly `` Obama has no background in economics . The Post says it 's Franklin Raines , for `` advice on mortgage and housing policy . '' Under Raines , Fannie Mae committed `` extensive financial fraud . '' Stuck with the bill . '' -- McCain video release , September 18 , 2008 . An already nasty presidential election campaign is getting nastier . The meltdown on Wall Street has touched off frantic attempts by both the McCain and Obama camps to secure political advantage and indulge in guilt by association . Over the past 24 hours , both campaigns have issued video press releases -LRB- let 's not call them ads until they actually air somewhere -RRB- attempting to show that the other side 's `` advisers '' are somehow responsible for the crisis . The latest McCain attack is particularly dubious . The McCain video attempts to link Obama to Franklin Raines , the former CEO of the bankrupt mortgage giant , Fannie Mae , who also happens to be African American . It then shows a photograph of an elderly white woman taxpayer who has supposedly been `` stuck with the bill '' as a result of the `` extensive financial fraud '' at Fannie Mae . The Obama campaign last night issued a statement by Raines insisting , `` I am not an advisor to Barack Obama , nor have I provided his campaign with advice on housing or economic matters . '' Obama spokesman Bill Burton went a little further , telling me in an e-mail that the campaign had `` neither sought nor received '' advice from Raines `` on any matter . '' So what evidence does the McCain campaign have for the supposed Obama-Raines connection ? It is pretty flimsy , but it is not made up completely out of whole cloth . McCain spokesman Brian Rogers points to three items in the Washington Post in July and August . It turns out that the three items -LRB- including an editorial -RRB- all rely on the same single conversation , between Raines and a Washington Post business reporter , Anita Huslin , who wrote a profile of the discredited Fannie Mae boss that appeared on July 16 . The profile reported that Raines , who retired from Fannie Mae four years ago , had `` taken calls from Barack Obama 's presidential campaign seeking his advice on mortgage and housing policy matters . '' Since this has now become a campaign issue , I asked Huslin to provide the exact circumstances of the quote . She explained that she was chatting with Raines during the photo shoot , and asked `` if he was engaged at all with the Democrats ' quest for the White House . He said that he had gotten a couple of calls from the Obama campaign . I asked him about what , and he said ` oh , general housing , economy issues . ' -LRB- ` Not mortgage\\/foreclosure meltdown or Fannie-specific , ' I asked , and he said ` no. ' -RRB- '' By Raines 's own account , he took a couple of calls from someone on the Obama campaign , and they had some general discussions about economic issues . I have asked both Raines and the Obama people for more details on these calls and will let you know if I receive a reply . The McCain campaign is clearly exaggerating wildly in attempting to depict Franklin Raines as a close adviser to Obama on `` housing and mortgage policy . '' If we are to believe Raines , he did have a couple of telephone conversations with someone in the Obama campaign . But that hardly makes him an adviser to the candidate himself -- and certainly not in the way depicted in the McCain video release . This morning 's stump speach by McCain asserted that sub prime loans were done by Fannie & Freddie and made no mention of the I-banks -LRB- UBS & Phil Graham -RRB- that are really at the heart of the hosuning meltdown . He makes claims of trying to reform Fannie & Freddie and predicted this mess . My understanding is that he just wanted to change the agency that oversees the GSEs . He is also wanted to reduce the CRA requirements for the banks . Choose the ex mortgage mogul to vet your VP . And the VP chosen , despite many positives , is way to cozy with sub prime\\/credit card lenders and has sponsored pro- foreclosure legislation . Really poor judgement by Obama to involve Johnson Posted by : kirk | September 19 , 2008 11:00 AM | Report abuse Trust the McCain campaign to come forth with another lie . Was John McCain EVER an honorable man ? I ca n't remember now . McCain 's camp took direct quotes from the WaPo . I wish all you liberal fanatics out there had the guts to call people liars face to face so you can get the punch in the nose you all richly deserve . On another point McCain 's saying that if he were President he would fire Cox is just so much noise since , under the law , heads of regulatory commissions -LRB- such as the SEC -RRB- have a fixed term precisely to insulate them from politics so they ca n't be fired , not even by the President . If he did n't know that then his trigger-happy , shoot first-think later reactions manifest a dangerous temperament for a president . I 'm loosing what little respect I did have for McCain . Joe Biden has many positives as you say , and it 's true that nobody 's perfect . Nobody can be in political life as long as he has and not have connections . Biden is a senator with a long record and a history that people can look through . A guy who 's thoughtful , intelligent , experienced and capable of being President if need be . Someone who can advise him on a lot of things : foreign relations , the economy , even the banking industry . Joe 's got no Presidential ambitions after this campaign , and he is pretty much immune to special interests as VP . He 'll be able to give advice without any conflicts of interest . A good solid pick for VP . By the way , I can make a case that picking Biden benefits Hillary Clinton 's bid for President in 2012 if Obama should lose , or in 2016 if he should win . If Obama loses , Clinton does not have the loser label from 2008 . She 'll be able to campaign as `` the one you should have picked '' , etc. . If Obama wins , two options : Clinton may be added to the ticket in 2012 . Biden could step down as he 's getting old and since Obama has 4 years in the White House his experience is less valuable . But Clinton may not want to be VP . VP 's do n't have a great track record : Bush I was the first sitting VP to be elected President since Martin Van Buren . So , if Obama wins he did Clinton a favor by not naming her VP . And if he loses , he also did her a favor by not naming her VP . He is the new JANUS . Implying that Raines is an advisor to Obama himself is misleading . My problem with the McCain campaign here is that they do n't need to distort anything . All they have to do is mention the Obama campaign called Raines about general housing , economy issues . Then bring up Jim Johnson and money received by Obama from the GSEs , and you have enough to hurt Obama on the issue . In the paragraph titled `` The Pinocchio Test '' , he refers to Raines as `` Howell Raines '' . I think the Fact Checker should check his Facts . Howell Raines is the former Executive Editor at the New York Times , and is definitely not Franklin Raines , formerly of Fannie Mae . He 's actually not .

CNN 's Fareed Zakaria says this move by Mubarak may be just trying to bait the protestors into more violence . Watch more about what this might mean and read an edited transcript from Zakaria : `` One hopes that history does not mark this as the moment that this revolution turned . For two weeks the demonstrators have been peaceful , they have been entirely democratic and incredibly honorable . But they 've been broken up , they have been beaten ; the regime has tried to divide the opposition , it has tried to make phony concessions . The one thing the regime did not do is concede to the principal demand . The danger here is that things will get radicalized . ... The opposition , the protesters , the crowds are going to get angrier and angrier . They 're going to draw perhaps more violent people . That is , in a sense , what the regime is hoping for . In a strange sense , I think the Mubarak regime is trying to bait the crowd in Tahrir Square and is hoping for violence and is hoping for some kind of march on the presidential palace that seems to get violent . Then they can step in and in the guise of restoring order , return to the military rule , return to the martial law that they want to consolidate . That 's the danger here . This might be a turn that history will record as the moment things went awry . '' After Vice President Omar Suleiman 's speech , Zakaria said the move discredited Suleiman as any kind of transitional figure : `` Egypt is a very nationalist country with a very proud people . It has a 7,000-year-old history , as President Mubarak pointed out -LRB- in his speech -RRB- . But I do n't think it 's going to work . What you just witnessed is Omar Suleiman discrediting himself as any kind of transitional figure . Omar Suleiman , the vice president , could have been the man who ushered in a new Egypt . He would n't have lasted but he would have been the man who brokered it all . But he has decided to stick with his boss . ... Suleiman is a former general , former head of military intelligence and President Mubarak 's consigliere . ... The regime is hoping that it can wait out these protestors . But I think the big mistake for the last two weeks that the regime has made is that it has kept assuming that these people are going to go home . And they do n't go home - the crowds just keep getting bigger and bigger and stronger and stronger . Friday will be a very crucial day because my guess is that you 'll see the largest protest you 've ever seen in Egypt . '' Have to agree with Zakaria . The minute Mubarek came out with `` as a father to his children '' I cringed and knew he had no intention whatsover of stepping down . Did n't even have to listen to the rest of the speech . Highly inflammatory at the least if not outright insulting to the protesters , imo . I 'd like to see any US President address fellow citizens as `` children . '' President Obama , CNN , and Anderson Cooper have this Egypt uprising dead wrong - 100 % wrong . Obama and CNN would have you believe that a President should just step down when 100,000 or even 1 milllion protestors take to the streets and demand he resign . That is not Democracy -- that is Anarchy and Obama and CNN are fueling the flames by going public and telling folks that Mubarack must begin to `` transition '' out now . DUMB Try this on for size Mr President - will you step down and begin to `` transition '' out if 1 million angry protestors stand outside the White House and demand you resign ? I mean 80 % of the Americans living here did not vote for you sir . More than half of the voters do not support you and think this country -- the good ole USA -- is heading in the wrong direction under your stewarship . Wky not Go Away - Game Over - I mean , what is good for Egypt must be good for the US - when the people revolt and protest outside the White House -- you should resign Mr Obama . Such is the absurdity of thei White House and CNN -- both get caught up in the frenzy and can not see the forest from the trees . If Obama wishes to support what is happening in Egypt , he needs to prepare for anarchy in the streets of every Mid East nation - and to expect nothing more here at home . Give it a rest CNN . Stop talking about it Mr President . it is not our place to dictate how other countries conduct their affairs -- and it is inflamatory and dangerous for US Presidents to be giving unwanted advice to foreign leaders , As for CNN , take Anderson Cooper off the story and give him a 2 month vacation with pay . He has lost all sense of objectivity and is just personally hurt he got beat up - something he and others deserved for going over their to falem the emotions of protestors . We have enough trouble at home Anderson - if you want to attack something big and ugly and out of control and hurting millions - report on the US economy , the deficit , the foreclosures , and the unemployed , and turn your anger and your cameras to Washington and the reaon source of the problems we face .

U.S. military officials said Saturday 's strikes had halted an advance by Muammar Gaddafi 's forces on the eastern rebel stronghold Benghazi and hit his air defenses , allowing western powers to send in planes to impose a no-fly zone . But the day-old U.N.-mandated military intervention to force Gaddafi 's troops to end attacks on civilians hit a diplomatic setback when the Arab League chief questioned the bombardment . `` What is happening in Libya differs from the aim of imposing a no-fly zone , and what we want is the protection of civilians and not the bombardment of more civilians , '' Egypt 's state news agency quoted Arab League Secretary-General Amr Moussa as saying . Gaddafi himself said the air strikes amounted to terrorism and vowed to fight to the death , although at 9 p.m. -LRB- 3 p.m. EDT -RRB- on Sunday an armed forces spokesman said the army was ordering all troops to cease fire immediately . The United States and Britain , who along with France , Italy and Canada have joined operation `` Odyssey Dawn , '' dismissed the ceasefire announcement , arguing that Gaddafi 's government had promised and then broken a ceasefire on Friday . In central Benghazi , sporadic explosions and heavy firing could be heard in the streets late in the evening . A Reuters witness said the firing lasted about 40 minutes . Residents had said they feared some of Gaddafi 's troops could try to force their way into the city , where they would be surrounded by civilians and protected from attacks from the air . Outside Benghazi , the advance by Gaddafi 's troops was stopped in its tracks , with smoldering , shattered tanks and troop carriers littering the main road . The charred bodies of at least 14 government soldiers lay scattered in the desert . However , government tanks did move into Misrata , the last rebel-held city in western Libya , seeking the shelter of built-up areas after a base used by Gaddafi 's forces outside was hit by Western air strikes , residents said . Abdelbasset , a spokesman for the rebels in Misrata , told Reuters : `` There is fighting between the rebels and Gaddafi 's forces . Their tanks are in the center of Misrata ... There are so many casualties we can not count them . '' A Libyan government health official said 64 people had been killed in the Western bombardment overnight from Saturday to Sunday , but it was impossible to verify the report . The Arab League 's Moussa called for an emergency meeting of the group of 22 states to discuss Libya . He requested a report into the bombardment , which he said had `` led to the deaths and injuries of many Libyan civilians . '' Arab backing for a no-fly zone provided crucial underpinning for the passage of a U.N. Security Council resolution last week that paved the way for Western action to stop Gaddafi killing civilians as he fights an uprising against his rule . The intervention is the biggest against an Arab country since the 2003 invasion of Iraq . Withdrawal of Arab support would make it much harder to pursue what some defense analysts say could in any case be a difficult , open-ended campaign with an uncertain outcome . Britain and the United States rebuffed Moussa 's comments . A senior U.S. official said a U.N. resolution endorsed by Arab states covered `` all necessary measures '' to protect civilians , `` which we made very clear includes , but goes beyond , a no-fly zone . '' The safe enforcement of the no-fly zone required the targeting of Libya 's air defense capabilities , a British Foreign Ministry spokesman said . A spokesman for the rebel movement criticized Moussa 's comments , telling Al Jazeera that more than 8,000 Libyans aligned with the rebel movement had been killed . `` Today , when the secretary-general spoke , I was surprised , '' Abdel Hafiz Ghoga said . `` What is the mechanism that stops the extermination of the people in Libya , what is the mechanism , Mr Secretary-General ? If the protection of civilians is not a humanitarian obligation , what is the mechanism that you propose to us ? '' The U.S. Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , Admiral Mike Mullen , said the no-fly zone was now in place . But he told CBS television the endgame of military action was `` very uncertain '' and acknowledged it could end in a stalemate with Gaddafi . Mullen said he had seen no reports of civilian casualties from the Western strikes . But Russia said there had been such casualties and called on Britain , France and the United States to halt the `` non-selective use of force . '' Libyan state television showed footage from an unidentified hospital of what it called victims of the `` colonial enemy . '' Ten bodies were wrapped up in white and blue bed sheets , and several people were wounded , one of them badly , the television said . The Libyan government has denied breaking a ceasefire that it announced on Friday , blaming rebels who it says are members of al Qaeda . The armed forces spokesman announced a new ceasefire on Sunday , saying that `` the Libyan armed forces ... have issued a command to all military units to safeguard an immediate ceasefire from 9 p.m. -LRB- 1900 GMT -RRB- this evening . '' Both before and after he spoke , heavy anti-aircraft gunfire boomed above central Tripoli . A senior military official said the United States expected to conduct more strikes on Libya . `` This is an ongoing military operation . I fully expect more strikes , '' he said . Britain said it was taking part in a second night of coordinated strikes and had once more launched Tomahawk cruise missiles from a submarine in the Mediterranean . Italy said it also had planes in the air . The United States , after embarking on wars in Afghanistan and Iraq , has been reluctant to take the lead in the military operation , keen to leave this to France and Britain while also assembling a large coalition to support it . French planes fired the first shots of the intervention on Saturday , destroying tanks and armored vehicles near Benghazi . France sent an aircraft carrier toward Libya and its planes were over the country again on Sunday , defense officials said . Britain said its planes had targeted Libya 's air defenses , mainly around the capital Tripoli . U.S. and British warships and submarines launched 110 Tomahawk missiles on Saturday night and Sunday morning against air defenses around Tripoli and Misrata , U.S. officials said . Aircraft from other countries , including Qatar , were also moving toward Libya to participate in the operation , Mullen said . -LRB- Reporting by Mohammed Abbes and Angus MacSwan in Benghazi , Maria Golovnina and Michael Georgy in Tripoli , Hamid Ould Ahmed and Christian Lowe in Algiers ; Tom Perry in Cairo , John Irish and Elizabeth Pineau in Paris , Missy Ryan in Washington , Matt Spetalnick in Rio de Janeiro ; Writing by Myra Macdonald ; Editing by Kevin Liffey -RRB- We welcome comments that advance the story through relevant opinion , anecdotes , links and data .

Z was a notorious and well-known figure in Libya . But the rebels took an important step toward international legitimacy when France recognized their national council . While oil prices have been kept high by the bombardments in the east of the Arab North African state , there was no clear sign of deliberate intent by Gaddafi to ruin oil infrastructure . NATO and the European Union were looking into imposing a `` no-fly '' zone over Libya to stop the government using jets and helicopters against the outgunned rebels , who seized a string of cities east and west of Tripoli early in the three-week-old war to end Gaddafi 's 41 years of iron-fisted rule . Despite rebel appeals to take the skies away from Gaddafi 's forces , no quick action was expected as NATO has made clear it needs wider , United Nations endorsement for such a move . More than 500 km -LRB- 300 miles -RRB- east of Tripoli , Gaddafi 's warplanes and gunboats off the Mediterranean coast bombarded rebels around Ras Lanuf , with projectiles crashing close to a building of the Libyan Emirates Oil Refinery Company . There was a series of air strikes , and insurgents fired anti-aircraft guns toward warplanes and rockets out to sea toward Gaddafi 's naval forces , without visible effect . Two rebel fighters said they saw Ras Lanuf 's residential area , including the vicinity of its hospital , get bombed and that government forces had fired rockets from sea , air and ground . There was no apparent damage to the hospital . Later , at least two tanks were seen bearing down on ragged rebel lines outside Ras Lanuf and opening fire . The rebels also reported an air strike on Brega , another oil port 90 km -LRB- 50 miles -RRB- east of Ras Lanuf , indicating that Gaddafi loyalists had not only halted a westwards insurgent push in its tracks but were making inroads into the rebels ' eastern centers . State television said rebels had been ousted from the port and airport of Es Sider , a further oil terminus about 40 km -LRB- 25 miles -RRB- up the coast west of Ras Lanuf . OPEC member Libya was turning away tankers from ports as storage depots dried up because of supply disruptions caused by the fighting . Libya 's oil trade has virtually been paralyzed as banks refuse to clear payments in dollars due to U.S. sanctions , cutting off major importers such as Italy and France . The intensified fighting near oil installations kept crude prices hovering near recent 2.5-year highs , with Brent crude trading at $ 114.55 a barrel . The rebels , hitherto bursting with confidence that they would soon charge hundreds of km -LRB- miles -RRB- up the Mediterranean desert coast , overwhelming any resistance , to capture Gaddafi 's main bastion Tripoli , now conceded they were struggling to hold ground against the government 's vastly superior firepower . '' -LRB- Gaddafi -RRB- might take it . With planes , tanks , mortars and rockets , he might take it , '' said rebel fighter Basim Khaled . `` A no-fly zone would be great , '' said rebel fighter Salem al-Burqy , echoing the view of many beleaguered cohorts . Gaddafi 's counter-offensive has stymied a rebel advance from their eastern power base of Benghazi . They were forced to withdraw from the front-line town of Bin Jawad , just west of Ras Lanuf , after coming under heavy shelling earlier this week . One fighter said rebels had retaken the heart of Zawiyah , the closest city -- 50 km -LRB- 30 miles -RRB- west -- to Tripoli , from the army overnight . Zawiyah 's center appeared to change hands twice during the day in a fierce battle . `` We fought until after three in the morning . It 's all quiet here this morning , '' said the insurgent , named Ibrahim , by phone . Mohamed , a Libyan in exile abroad who got through to a relative on the outskirts of Zawiyah Thursday morning , said it was simply not clear who was winning the battle for the city but the army had it under siege to break the rebels ' will . `` Yesterday -LRB- rebel sympathizers -RRB- tried to bring food and medicine from Subratha but failed . Government troops surround Zawiyah from everywhere . It is unclear who controls the center . It changes all the time . It 's street to street fighting . '' Authorities have kept journalists away from Zawiyah . France became the first significant country Thursday to recognize the rebel Libyan National Council as the legitimate representative of the Libyan people . An official at President Nicolas Sarkozy 's office said France would send an ambassador to Benghazi and receive a Libyan envoy in Paris . He was speaking after Sarkozy met officials from the Libyan National Council . Britain 's Foreign Office suggested it could make the same opening as France , saying Libyan National Council members were `` valid interlocutors '' and Gaddafi should step down now . `` The UK recognizes states , not governments . The interim national council are valid interlocutors , with whom we wish to work closely , '' a Foreign Office spokesman said . The U.S. Defense Department said it was preparing a `` full range '' of military options for Libya , including a no-fly zone . NATO ministers were to weigh up options at talks in Brussels on Thursday . Military officers said a zone could be set up quickly . Rebel forces have appealed to Washington and its allies to impose a no-fly zone to deny Gaddafi 's forces the advantage of using warplanes and prevent him moving troops by helicopter . A no-fly zone could also help protect civilians who have been caught in the fighting , with scores if not more people reported killed so far in cities like Zawiyah . A burgeoning humanitarian emergency could hasten a no-fly decision . CALL TO AVOID SHOOTING AT CIVILIANS In Geneva , the International Committee of the Red Cross said Libya had descended into civil war with increasing numbers of wounded civilians arriving in hospitals in the east . ICRC President Jakob Kellenberger called on Libyan authorities to grant the humanitarian agency access to western areas including the capital Tripoli and reminded both sides that civilians and medical facilities must not be targeted . General Raymond Odierno , commander of the U.S. Joint Forces Command , said the U.S. military was probably capable of establishing a `` no-fly '' zone over Libya `` within a couple of days '' if the international community so decided . U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has made it clear imposing a no-fly zone is a matter for the United Nations and should not be a U.S.-led initiative . Russia and China , permanent members of the U.N. Security Council , oppose the idea , which could entail bombing Libyan air defenses as a first step . Russia said Thursday military intervention would be unacceptable , but acted to help isolate Gaddafi by banning all weapons sales to Libya , effectively suspending major arms contracts with his government . Italy , whose bases could play a critical role in any military action , has said it will back any decisions taken by NATO , the EU or the United Nations , clearing the way for U.S. naval forces based in Naples to be deployed if needed . Two members of Libya 's opposition council visited the European Parliament Wednesday and said they wanted EU moral support , political recognition and a no-fly zone shielding the territory they hold -- but not any form of military intervention in a country sensitive about former colonial domination . Counter-attacks by Gaddafi loyalists suggest the flamboyant leader , in power since a 1969 coup , will not go as quietly or quickly as fellow leaders in Egypt and Tunisia did in a tide of popular unrest rolling across the Arab world . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . It is simply a fantasy he wo n't attack them . When loyalists can not overtake the strong-hold of the rebels , the pro-Gadi camp is likely to destroy the enemy 's wealth i.e. oil facilities .

Since the 20 April catastrophe there has been much discussion in US Congressional hearings and the media about the sequence of events that led up to it . Here is a summary of what we know so far about the BP oil spill , and the primary questions that are still being investigated . The Deepwater Horizon rig was drilling an oil well in the Macondo prospect that was intended to be plugged with cement and then completed later to become a production well . The top of the well was about 5,000 ft -LRB- 1,524 m -RRB- beneath the surface of the Gulf of Mexico . The Deepwater Horizon was owned and mostly staffed by employees of exploration firm Transocean , under contract to BP . BOP : Blowout preventer - stack of valves designed to stop blowouts Blind ram shear : Last line of defense in BOP - cuts pipe Centraliser : Device to keep pipe or casing in center of well Cement bond log : Tests to make sure cement is sound Annulus : Gap between pipe and rock , or between pipe and another pipe Underwater oil wells are not just holes with a drilling pipe stuck into them . As the drilling is done , a fluid , usually mud is forced out of the drill bit and debris is thus pushed upwards . This fluid also counteracts the pressure to stop oil and gas forcing their way upwards . Once each passage of drilling is completed , metal casing is cemented into place in the hole . In this case the well had already been cemented ready for abandonment . At the point the disaster occurred , the well was essentially finished . How cement and casing is placed in drilling borehole Drill , lowered from rig , bores through seabed creating a borehole for sections of casing pipe to be lowered into Casing pipe is lowered into borehole allowing cement to be pumped down the pipe to fix it in place Once the cement is set and secure another stage of drilling begins In his evidence to a Congressional committee on 19 May , Transocean chief executive Steve Newman noted that the well was `` essentially complete '' with drilling having finished three days before the disaster on 17 April . He said : `` The one thing we do know is that on the evening of 20 April , there was a sudden catastrophic failure of the casing , the cement or both . Without a failure of one of those elements , the explosion could not have occurred . '' Cementing issues being investigated by Transocean include the type of nitrogen-foamed cement used , the volume and the time it was allowed to `` cure '' . The BP investigation released on 8 September said data from the fateful day suggested that oil and gas had passed through the cement at the bottom of the well , through a device known as a `` shoe track '' and up the casing . The cement used was foamed with nitrogen . The BP team criticised providers Halliburton for doing `` inadequate lab tests '' on the cement mix . Much has been made in Congressional hearings of the number of centralisers used . These devices make sure that the pipe or casing is centralised during cementing , to ensure a good job is done . Congressmen say Halliburton recommended that 21 should be used , but BP decided only six should be used . In an e-mail , a BP engineer said : `` But , who cares , it 's done , end of story , will probably be fine and we 'll get a good cement job . '' The BP investigation said the 15 centralisers were ready for use on the rig , but workers wrongly thought they were of a type that would have caused problems . They decided not to use them . This decision was wrong , but did not contribute to the disaster , the BP team said . Because of the importance of getting a good cement job in the well , one that is bonded both to the casing and to the geological formation in which the well is dug , a series of measurements called a `` cement bond log '' is usually run . A sonic scanning device is lowered through the well on a wireline . It checks whether there are imperfections in bonding or other problems in the cement . If there are , more cement can be squeezed into affected sections . Documents presented to Congress show a team from Schlumberger were called to the rig to be ready to do such work , but that they departed on the morning of the disaster having been told their services were not required . Other documents suggest the cost saving in not having a `` cement bond log '' to be about $ 118,000 . `` The cement bond log not being done at that point was n't a wrong choice , '' said BP investigation team leader Mark Bly . He did say that there should have been a `` risk assessment '' that might have included a cement bond log , but emphasised that it might not have spotted any problems . Another issue was the type of casing that would be used on the final , bottom section of the well . BP opted for a single line of casing from the seabed down to the bottom of the well , Congressman say . The more expensive option would have been to use a `` liner '' , a bit of casing hung from the bottom of the casing section above . Inside this would have been a further piece of tubing called a `` tieback '' . This arrangement would have created more barriers to the upward flow of oil and gas , but it would also have been more expensive . The BP team found that the suggestion that the firm used the wrong well design by not opting for a `` liner with tieback '' had no bearing on the disaster . This option would have guarded against oil flowing up the annulus , the space between the casing and the geological formation . But BP believes it went straight up the casing . BP 's investigation said it took 49 minutes after the first oil and gas flowed up the well before Transocean workers on the rig took action to control the situation . By extension , this suggests that they did not notice until that point that there was a big problem . `` It is also clear that the drill crew had very little , if any , time to react . The initial indications of trouble and the subsequent explosions were almost instantaneous . '' The surge of gas that reached the surface ignited . Transocean identified two nearby vessels , the rig 's own engines and some equipment as the possible source of the accidental ignition . BP 's investigation was unable to ascertain the cause of ignition . But their team did identify one crucial decision leading to the blast . A worker pressed a button to send the flow from the well to a device called a mud-gas separator , but the valves at various points in the system could n't deal with the pressure and failed . A cloud of gas was soon all over the ship . Instead , the gas and oil could have been sent overboard , but that still might not have stopped the gas igniting . This meant the sensors were active but the alarm would not actually sound , to avoid the crew being awoken at night . Transocean said the setup was standard practice and there were in any case hundreds of other alarms . In the blast and fire , 11 rig workers died , with more injured . Just over 36 hours later the rig sank . Whatever the exact cause of what happened , it is clear there was some sort of gas-kick and blowout resulting in an uncontrolled upward surge of oil and gas flow to the surface .

The BOP , the size of a five-storey building , consists of a series of high-pressure valves , designed to prevent such a surge or kick from damaging the drilling operation .

If a resistant strain of H1N1 swine flu starts circulating it would be a concern . Britain has invested a huge amount in its stockpile of Tamiflu and will eventually have enough to treat eight in 10 of the population . If it does n't work in many people that would be a setback , but remember that the vast majority of people who 've been infected with H1N1 swine flu have had a self-limiting illness and have overcome it without antivirals . If resistance emerges it would also mean that the virus is mutating -LRB- as all flu viruses do -RRB- and there may be questions about what other surprises it might have in store in the months ahead . So what actually happened in Denmark ? David Reddy , Roche 's pandemic taskforce leader , said although Tamiflu-resistant isolates had been obtained from a patient it looks as though this was drug-induced . This means that the virus developed resistance while the patient was taking Tamiflu . There were other patients in the same cluster outbreak and no resistance to Tamiflu was found in any of them . The phenomenon of drug-induced resistance is quite different from having a Tamiflu-resistant strain in circulation . By contrast there has been a Tamiflu-resistant strain of H1N1 seasonal flu in circulation since 2008 . `` There is no sign yet of a Tamiflu resistant strain -LRB- of H1N1 swine flu -RRB- circulating '' said Mr Reddy . `` We fully expect to see more cases where the virus may begin to develop resistance while people are taking the drug . '' This is the statement that Roche has put out : Roche is providing comment on the report of an oseltamivir resistant isolate of an influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- obtained from a single patient in Denmark . Roche reiterates that such resistant isolates in people on the drug is to be expected , as resistance at a rate of 0.4 % and 4 % was observed in adult and paediatric populations respectively in the phase III studies . -LRB- 1 -RRB- It is therefore expected that in some patients receiving antiviral medication , resistant virus will emerge . However , it is important to note that this does not mean that the currently circulating pandemic influenza A -LRB- H1N1 -RRB- virus is resistant . Ongoing testing shows that other currently circulating pandemic virus remains susceptible to Tamiflu . Communications from Denmark indicated that this was not unexpected and was not a reason to change recommendations on the use of Tamiflu . WHO recommendations remain unaltered . In addition to monitoring by government agencies , WHO and other public institutions , Roche recently initiated the global Influenza Resistance Information Study -LRB- IRIS -RRB- , which will include 1,200 patients per influenza season from 2008-2011 and will assess the clinical impact of naturally-occurring and drug-induced resistance to antiviral drugs . Roche also continues to support the activities of the Neuraminidase Inhibitor Susceptibility Network . -LRB- 1 -RRB- Aoki FY , Boyvin G and Roberts N.

As weapons get bigger , more powerful and more damaging to environments , is n't it ironic that something so tiny as a virus could ultimately dominate our lives .

If we go all out to destroy the mechanism for virus replication we may inadvertently cause our own ability to replicate , to diminish . Last night I watched the film , Children of Men , and the follow up discussion , and have come to the conclusion that we as a species , are long overdue for a change of attitude . Whilst I can think of many possible ways that our human existance -LRB- at least as we currently understand it -RRB- may be under threat - e.g. global warming , peak oil , abuse of political powers , abuse of financial powers , revolution , war , terrorism and a whole raft of differing health risks , including some that we thought we had dealt with once and for all -LRB- e.g. TB -RRB- - I 'm just not putting this particular flu variant that near the top of the list .

The Puppy Bowl , a dog-friendly game featuring puppies , was canceled by Fox because it contained `` religious doctrine , '' according to a firm spokesman . Next came JesusHatesObama.com , a political novelty t-shirt company that had dueling bobble heads of Jesus and Obama . The company said Fox rejected its ad . Fox did n't comment . The Fixed Point Foundation , a group that promotes Christianity in the public square , told CNN that Fox rejected its proposed Super Bowl ad last June . In the ad , people watching a football game spy the phrase John 3:16 - a New Testament verse popular among evangelical Christians -- on a player 's eye black . A man in the ad says he 's going to look it up , with the ad directing viewers to lookup316 . Fixed Point Executive Director Larry Taunton said Fox told him his commercial was rejected because it contained `` religious doctrine , '' though he said the ad avoided featuring the actual words of the verse . Everyone we dealt with at Fox couldn t have been more gracious or professional . I talked to them the day after last year s Super Bowl , Taunton said . Increasingly religion and Christianity is treated like smoking - you can do it but only in designated areas , he said . They were saying there s no place for -LRB- faith -RRB- in the public square . There s a place for the soft core porn of Go-Daddy , violent movie trailers , and irresponsible drinking , but not for faith . As a workaround , the Fixed Point Foundation ran its ad on Fox stations in Birmingham , Alabama and Washington , DC . Taunton said his group will try again or a Super Bowl ad next year . At the Eatocracy DC Super Bowl party I attended on Sunday night , there was consternation that during the halftime show , Usher appeared to be changing the lyrics to his song OMG from `` Oh my God '' to `` Oh my gosh . '' The move was resoundingly denounced by party guests as an overly politically correct move . Turns out the song has always been `` Oh My Gosh . '' The game itself saw plenty of touchdown end zone kneeling celebrations , including Green Bay wide receiver Greg Jennings kneeling and bowing his head after catching one of his two touchdown catches . And there were plenty God shout-outs in post-game coverage . A jubilant Jennings repeatedly told Fox 's Pam Oliver , `` To God be the glory . '' What 's God got to do with the Super Bowl ? Well , the Bible prohibits working on the Sabbath , so the game was subject to divine retribution from the start . Also , the Bible prohibits wearing fabric cut from different cloth , as well as shaving , things which many of the fans and players were guilty of . Coveting thy neighbor 's wife is also forbidden -LRB- are you listening , Rothlesberger ? -RRB- . We can only hope that no shrimp or BBQ pork were being consumed , since they are Biblically verbotten as well . In fact , it 's amazing the Lord did n't smite the whole heathen spectacle . But He was probably watching the Puppy Bowl anyway . John 3:16 ... there seems to be another `` controversial '' commercial that is getting passed around as well . it actually comments on the very verse of John 3:16 . it does n't look like the christians are liking it too much . maybe just a little too much TRUTH for them ?? They are going to have a PRAY OFF game soon apparently . . the teams will stand around a ball and pray . . when god kicks the ball over the line , that team wins . . So my gay and lesbian friends can shout '' we 're gay and proud ... Get used to it '' ... No issue . My African American relatives can see to the roof tops `` say it loud , I 'm black and I am proud '' ... No issue . Both statement can be proclaimed in the public arena , ... Shamed , as they should be , to those who attempt to say that either groups should not proclaim such . But , y ' all athiest think that we people of faith should do so in private and shame . Are you guys and girls actually that narrowminded and believing that you can force any group `` into the closet '' , be they Christians or any group . The moment you pressure one group back into the closet or the privacy of their own homes you are talking of oppression . Once you go down that road goodbye LGBT , any ethinic multiculturalism . Do not think it would stop there . Possibly because one 's skin color or se-xual orientation are natural , yet have been historically discriminated against . Your religion is personal choice . @W247 -- If you were offended with the way I said something then I apologize . Whether the true age of the earth is known to an exact year is debatable but it can not be said that just because we do not know the exact age that anything is possible . With radiometric age dating it clearly can be shown that the age of the earth as referred to in the Bible is incorrect . I guess every Christian I have talked to believes in the earth being relatively young but I should not paint you with this broad brush since you may have a different take on this matter . Also I have only recently begun studying the bible as I stated above but where does it talk about dinosaurs and what exactly does it say ? I have never heard of this before and it interests me a great deal , thank you for pointing it out , cheers . @W247 -- maybe you should come talk to those who ring my bell then . We have asked repeatedly for them to stop and have a no soliciting sign but that does n't stop them because they say it is their goal to spread the good word . Also not all Christians or Christian faith groups have the same beliefs or religious culture . I would not ever speak on behalf of all Sikhs of the world because even within the faith there are many different types of people , with different views and beleifs and how they interept what is written , told or passed on to them so how you would possibly know whether someone should be in church or not and at what time is beyond me . You tell me that you have been studying the the age of the earth yet you have no response or conclusion except to ask me what I have come up with . The Guru Granth Sahib is the Sikhs holy book and speaks of this , pick it up and take a read and broaden your mind , I am in the process of reading the Bible , have read passages of the Koran as well . The Sikhs holy book is the only one I know of that speaks about dinosaurs , space and time travel , multipile universes along with being good to others , peaceful living , hardwork , respect and faith that good will prevail . @well read -- you are absolutley right , you should just believe what is written in the bible and run with it . Maybe i 'm just naive or a product of the teachings my parents passed on to me but I was taught to question everything and constantly learn and grow , this again is also written in the Guru Granth Sahib and to never get stagnant and always expand your mind , body and soul . Also notice I did not say how old the earth was I just stated that the Bible is wrong and this obvious mistake or lie has not been acknowledged by those who follow blindly . You just assumed that I went with what certain scientists have stated . @GSA : since you did not state , and seemed to be reasonably minded , I did ask you what your base was for the age of the Earth .

CANDY CROWLEY , HOST : It took 18 days to remove a dictator of 30 years . Egypt is a different place now , but in the aftermath of euphoria the question is the same -- what next for Egyptians , for the region and the world , for the U.S. ? The first definition of revolution in the dictionary reads an overthrow or repudiation and the thorough replacement of an established government or political system . The realistic expectations have been raised very high . After the dictator , we 'll talk with our reporters about Egypt under military rule , Washington 's next moves with Republican Lindsey Graham from the Senate Armed Services Committee , and the impact on the region with former U.N. Ambassador John Negroponte and former Ambassador to Egypt Edward Walker . Then the administration 's next challenge -- budget cutting . We are joined by the head of the Office of Management and Budget Jacob Lew . I 'm Candy Crowley and this is `` State of the Union . '' Some breaking news out of Egypt , a military spokesman has just read an announcement with significant developments . The Egyptian military has suspended the constitution and the transition government will run the country for six months or until elections of the parliament . We have two correspondents standing by : Ivan Watson in Cairo and Nic Robertson who had driven to Sharm el-Sheikh , where former President Mubarak is reported to be . First to you Ivan , can you help translate to us whether you think this sort of action , suspending the constitution , putting a time limit it would seem , on how long the military will stay in control , is that enough to empty the square for weeks to come ? WATSON : The square is mostly empty right now , Candy . The military swept in yesterday and continued today trying to push protesters out , tear down a lot of tents in some cases despite objections from some of the more die-hard demonstrators who have said they do not want to leave until they are 100 % confident all demands are met . I was down there an hour or two ago and actually saw actually the Red Beret military police detaining some demonstrators and small scuffles breaking out . This move is pretty dramatic , because there 's been a question in the air , who is in charge . The Prime Minister Ahmed Shafik who you spoke to last week on the phone just made an announcement , but there was no warning that the military was going to announce such sweeping changes , assuming so much responsibility of the state saying that it was going to dissolve parliament , suspend the constitution , be the representative of Egypt both domestically and internationally and oversee the process of trying to set up the next presidential and parliamentary elections . When it comes to the parliament -- dissolving the parliament , I think the military will have the support of much of the protest movement because the parliament has very little credibility here after the very troubled and widely perceived as rigged election of last November and December -- Candy . CROWLEY : I may have put the question inartfully . What I 'm trying to get as is do you think the moves by the military will be satisfactory to protesters and they will , in fact , stay out of the square , that this is what they wanted , this puts them on the road to where they want to go . Are these good things ? WATSON : I think for the time being many of the demonstrators and protesters are supporting the military and have been working hand in glove in the square , for example , sweeping up debris , repainting the curbs there and you still have hordes of people coming to take photos with the military . The military is riding high now . But there are from some segments of this really historic opposition movement , this protest movement , are some suspicions and there are some doubts . But I think it 's safe to say that the majority of them are kind of in a wait and see mode . It is important to note outside the square we are seeing protests cropping up around some of the main banks , for example , people demanding higher wages , angry at their bosses , the chairman of those companies arguing that the salaries there are too high . And it is likely we 'll continue to see this bubbling ferment of discontent with some of the older institutions in this country that still may be run by people who were very close to the Mubarak regime . The expectations have been raised very high . And as one demonstrator told me today in the square , we have had a revolution . Mubarak is gone now but we still have the same 80 million problems in this country , meaning the entire population of Egypt . CROWLEY : Let me turn now to our Nic Robertson . Nic , I know you drove to Sharm el-Sheikh , so you were able some of the countryside . What we have seen for 18 days has been really Tahrir Square and parts of Cairo . Is it any different ? As you traveled did anything catch your attention ? ROBERTSON : I think there is a lot of military presence controlling the main checkpoints that go under the tunnel under the Suez Canal -- obviously the Suez Canal is strategically vital to the world . Egypt knows that , the army knows that , and they have put in , from what we can see , very tough and stringent checks either side of that tunnel to make sure that everyone that goes through is identified and has their bags searched . It does mean there are long delays . But it does mean it would be hard for terrorists to strike underneath the tunnel and damage this vital part of the global transport network or the shipping network . We also saw driving across the desert , in the Sinai Desert , where it 's incredibly remote , Bedouin farmers , more goats and sheep at checkpoints than policemen , but spray painted on the side in the middle of the desert was `` go Mubarak . '' And I think that really gives you an indication that it was n't just what we were seeing in Tahrir Square but it was across the country that people had the same spirit and feeling that it was time for President Mubarak to step down , Candy . CROWLEY : Nic , tell me about Mubarak . Are we certain he is in his residence in Sharm el-Sheikh ? And is it a given that he can , as he once expressed interest in living out his days in Egypt . Are Egyptians likely to let him live on in peace there ? ROBERTSON : He is -- if you look over my shoulder here , you will see a low white wall some distance behind me there . That is the wall of his presidential compound . It 's incredibly tightly guarded at the moment . To get on the road that drives down there , there are police checkpoints , the police have automatic weapons . There are plain clothes security personnel who ask you searching questions about who you are , what you do , where you 're going to get down the road that approaches that door . And I can certainly tell you that there are very heavy security installations around and at the moment the government here seems to be providing a high level of security for President Mubarak at this time . It 's very close to us here , Candy . CROWLEY : Nic Robertson in Sharm el-Sheikh , Ivan Watson in Cairo , a salute to both of you . Just such great work . We appreciate your time . Up next , Republican Senator Lindsay Graham on how the U.S. should handle the revolution in Egypt . CROWLEY : Joining me now from Greenville , South Carolina , Republican Senator Lindsey Graham . Senator , thank you . I 'm not sure if you got to hear the breaking news at the top of the show , but essentially the military council has said that they have suspended the constitution and that they will be conducting things for the next six months or until there are elections .

Summers , it turns out -- according to financial disclosure statements released by the White House late on Friday -- was paid $ 5.2 million for his part-time work for a massive hedge fund last year . He also raked in more than $ 2.7 million in fees for speaking engagements at such places as Citigroup , Lehman Brothers , Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs . For one speech alone last April , Goldman Sachs paid him a cool $ 135,000 . All of a sudden , Obama 's expressions of outrage over the culture of excessive pay on Wall Street are a bit harder to take at face value . And the advice Obama is getting from Summers , his economic guru , is looking very suspect . I mean , come on : How tough are you going to be on someone who paid you $ 135,000 in one day ? It 's become increasingly clear over the last several months that despite the Obama administration 's generally progressive economic views and sporadic bouts of populist rhetoric , the White House has something of a soft spot for Wall Street . Especially when it comes to financial rescue plans , Obama and his aides have held back from applying the tough medicine that an ever-growing number of economists say is necessary . Consider , for instance , the contrast between these two stories : Amit R. Paley and David Cho wrote in Saturday 's Washington Post that the Obama administration is `` engineering its new bailout initiatives in a way that it believes will allow firms benefiting from the programs to avoid restrictions imposed by Congress , including limits on lavish executive pay '' ; while James Doran writes in the Guardian that `` Elizabeth Warren , chief watchdog of America 's $ 700 billion bank bailout plan , will this week call for the removal of top executives from Citigroup , AIG and other institutions that have received government funds in a damning report that will question the administration 's approach to saving the financial system from collapse . '' Friday night may seem like several news cycles ago to our fast-moving media , but the public deserves to hear from Summers directly about how he can possibly maintain that he does n't owe any loyalty to the financial interests that showered him with money until a few months ago and that he now seems to be protecting . Why is n't his advice inherently suspect given how he is a veritable poster boy for the Wall Street culture that Obama called a `` house of cards '' and a `` Ponzi scheme '' in which `` a relatively few do spectacularly well while the middle class loses ground '' ? Is n't he part of the problem , not part of the solution ? And , yes , I know Obama is overseas and busy doing other things right now , but when he gets back , he needs to explain why he still trusts Summers . And he needs to directly address the concern that he has made a mistake in surrounding himself with economic advisers who come from the very Wall Street culture that is responsible for this crisis in the first place . One of Obama 's great strengths as a campaigner and a writer was his ability to explain his thought processes . Now as president , as I 've written time and again , Obama needs to do a better job of explaining how he reaches his conclusions , in particular regarding economic policy . The White House announced to the press corps late Friday afternoon that the financial disclosure statements were available -- upon request . Both The Washington Post and the New York Times published their resulting stories inside the A section . Both led with the Summers disclosures . Philip Rucker and Joe Stephens also noted for The Post that the forms `` show that many of Obama 's top aides earned generous salaries , investment income and fees for delivering speeches and serving on corporate boards . '' Here 's the official White House statement on Summers : '' ` Given that Dr. Summers is widely recognized as one of the country 's most distinguished economists and formerly served as Treasury secretary , there was considerable interest in hearing his economic insights from companies across various industries , ' White House spokesman Ben LaBolt said . '' Jeff Zeleny noted in the New York Times : `` Mr. Summers , the director of the National Economic Council , wields important influence over Mr. Obama s policy decisions for the troubled financial industry , including firms from which he recently received payments . '' The Times also Web-published several of the forms , and reports that they `` also shed further light on the compensation received by a top Obama aide who previously worked for Citigroup , one of the largest recipients of taxpayer bailout money . The aide , Michael Froman , deputy national security adviser for international economic affairs , received more than $ 7.4 million from the company from January 2008 to when he joined the White House this year . `` That money included a year-end bonus of $ 2.25 million for work in 2008 , which Citigroup paid him in January . Such bonuses have prompted political controversy in recent months , including sharp criticism from Mr. Obama , who in January branded them as ` shameful . ' '' Rucker had another story inside Sunday 's Post about how some top Obama `` economic advisers were paid , in some cases handsomely , for their commentaries in 2008 about tax policy , government bailouts of financial institutions , global trade and the economic recession . '' But the Summers disclosure has gone largely uncommented-upon in the traditional media . Mark Seibel , blogging for the McClatchy Washington bureau , seems to be the only person asking one obvious question : `` Is n't this what got Daschle in trouble ? '' Indeed , Obama 's good friend and would-be health czar Tom Daschle withdrew his nomination as secretary of health and human services in early February not only because of his failure to pay back taxes , but also because of the perception of a conflict caused by the -LRB- considerably fewer -RRB- millions of dollars he earned from insurers and other corporate interests . The White House 's timing somehow seems to have muffled reaction even in the blogosphere -- with at least one very notable exception . Salon blogger Glenn Greenwald calls the outsized payments Summers received for speaking engagements `` basically an advanced bribe . And it 's paying off in spades . And none of it seemed to bother Obama in the slightest when he first strongly considered naming Summers as Treasury Secretary and then named him his top economics adviser instead -LRB- thereby avoiding the need for Senate confirmation -RRB- , knowing that Summers would exert great influence in determining who benefited from the government 's response to the financial crisis ... Greenwald also writes about Summers 's role , while he was Treasury Secretary under Bill Clinton , in blocking regulatory reform of the kind of financial instruments that precipitated the current crisis . `` Just think about how this works . People like Rubin , Summers and Gensler shuffle back and forth from the public to the private sector and back again , repeatedly switching places with their GOP counterparts in this endless public\\/private sector looting . When in government , they ensure that the laws and regulations are written to redound directly to the benefit of a handful of Wall St. firms , literally abolishing all safeguards and allowing them to pillage and steal . Then , when out of government , they return to those very firms and collect millions upon millions of dollars , profits made possible by the laws and regulations they implemented when in government . Then , when their party returns to power , they return back to government , where they continue to use their influence to ensure that the oligarchical circle that rewards them so massively is protected and advanced .

Ron Paul 2012 June 15 , 2011 at 2:22 pm | As far as I am concerned , every President and every Congress since Eisenhower are guilty of violating the Constitution . I grew up thinking it took an act of Congress to declare war , and a military incursion into sovereign countries without first declaring war is in itself an act justifying the declaration of war . What we have had all along are a bunch of chickenhawks pandering to the military industrial complex but terrified to actually declare war . What justification would we have needed to invade Vietnam , Grenada , Iraq , Afghanistan , and others ? Were the USA to actually declare war , we 'd have to gain the support of Americans first . This bunch of spineless cowards know nothing but sleazy politics and would never risk anything by committing to a real war . It breaks my heart to see Americans volunteer to act like lawless marauders under the guise of `` saving the world and the USA .

June 15 , 2011 at 4:10 pm | Your logic is flawed . Because even if Clinton did fail to get Osama Bin Laden , Bush as President and Commander-in-Chief had a choice about how to respond to 9-11 .

'' Also , there was this exchange about it being `` over '' : MORGAN : If you do n't have world leaders telling him publicly it 's over , are n't you going to create a - a vacuum and a void here into which the extremists could well come ? BLAIR : Well , it is over , in the sense that whatever we 're talking about , we 're talking about a period of transition until we get to elections . I really like your show and your doing a great job . But please quit saying in every interview the you playing devils advocate . It dosent sound good when you say it in every interview . February 2 , 2011 at 9:47 am | Report abuse | I watch CNN 24\\/7 , and in every country I go to , it is the first thing I turn on to feel at home . I never noticed anything about an interviewer before , like I have noticed that Piers cuts of his guests , in the middle of sentences - like a friend that is thinking about what they are going to say next while you are still talking . It is so frustrating to listen to and downright painful to watch . Maybe other interviews do it , I however they do it , I have never noticed it . Piers cuts of his guests in the middle of sentences . `` Piers Morgan Tonight is not edited , '' Piers said . He could be cutting off his guests due to nerves . February 1 , 2011 at 11:04 pm | Report abuse | I quite agree that he interupts and cuts people off mid sentence -- very annoying - it is almost as if he is not interested in the answer . Oprah does it as well . February 2 , 2011 at 2:03 am | Report abuse | Your editing and cutting off of guests is appalling . Hire some new people for your staff . Also keep in mind your role here on CNN Mr. Morgan ... ... this is n't tabloid news ! February 2 , 2011 at 7:35 pm | Report abuse | SHUT THEIR MOUTH AND MIND THEIR OWN BUSINESS !! Dang !! ... given that we have our own organizations setup to specificly start these problems for other countries ... Some people , I swear ! I think British must stay away from all the problems in this world . Their greed and colonial time created all these pains and agony for 2\\/3 of the world population . That pretty much goes for the US as well does it not ? @Dave , could you sound slightly more like a retarded 12-year-old ? February 1 , 2011 at 8:12 pm | Report abuse | Can you say English please because the Scottish , -LRB- Me -RRB- Welsh and Irish were also colonised to an extent ! lol Blair , you and your country are to be blame to everything bad that happens in the middle east . Blair , you lost a golden oportunity ti keep your mouth closed ! I do not think Tony Blair speak too much , he made international mess in UK , if will better for him to go and live peacefully in India or Thailand where God exists Shaji , I think you 're wrong ! The brits can not stay away from all the problems of this world just because , if they 're not the problem itself , they in one way or another helped to create it ! It 's utterly PATHETIC for Tony Blair to comment on what 's happening in Egypt or the region for that matter . He , as most `` experts '' in the Middle East , did not see the revolution of Freedom and Dignity coming in Tunisia and still does n't grasp its meaning . That revolution , being replicated in Egypt , is about the people taking matters in their own hands to let their regime and its foreign cronies know that they 've had enough and that they can manage their affairs on their own . Get used to it , Tony Blair , and find another line of work if you have any decency left . Blair should keep his mouth shut , he 's a total gaff . Especially when it comes to the Mideast , he 's simply a puppet . It seems that the only reason that the Westt is not completely siding with the people and fearing the fall of Mubarak is worry about Israel 's security . How long are we going to step on our values , principles , and way of life to please Israel that is not ever satisfied and often snubs its finger on our face ? If Israel was out of the equation , then I have no doubt that the West would be supporting the people , their freedom and democracy 100 % . The simple fact is that any democracy , whether bring Islamists to power or not , will not take Israeli abuses and atrocities lightly , while a paid coward dictator shields Israel . That 's why the West is really worried . Time to be on the right side of history , dump colonist fanatic unwavering Israel , live up to our principles of support to freedom , democracy , and human rights . Then , we would be cherished and our TRUE interests would be protected . Who the hell care what Tony Blair has to say . He has ruined his reputation so badly by being George Bush 's lap-dog . He should disappear with whatever dignity he has left and never been seen or heard again . Just like Colin Powell , and Condi Rice . As much as I find the irritating British accent annoying , I can deal with Tony Blair . I just ca n't stand YOU Pi-ss O-ff Morgan . Get off the air . I hate your annoying British accent . If an anchor had a Chinese accent , they would never be allowed on the air unless they were reporting on China . This is America and I really wish you 'd get off our air waves and go broadcast for your own people in the UK who do n't find your accent as annoying . Go away , please . wow , what a simple minded person you must be to be concerned about accents , if only the whole world was america and everyone spoke the same , would that make your life easier ? Well , not really . By your comment , I 'm assuming that you are saying you are not `` simple minded '' ! OK , Let 's see how you are NOT `` simple minded '' . consider this : If he had an Indian or Chinese or African accent , he would never even have a chance to be on the air here in America . A British accent is still a foreign accent and just as -LRB- if not more -RRB- annoying . Get him off the air . I 'm sick of his irritating voice !

I will avoid watching the Tony B-Liar interview , however ! Surely you could find something more important on which to focus your attention . Simply change the station and in the process , take your absurd comments elsewhere . Right ... we should all listen to him . . He and Bush got us into a disastrous war under false pretences . He needs to go away and let Sovereign nations solve their own problems . Hosni Mubarak , who engineered 9\\/11 to sell hatred of Islam for 10 years ? yes of course all the evil in the world is the fault of the usa and the uk ... all ignorant infidels ... muslims are the pure saints of the world oh and the muslim brotherhood are the greatest saints of all , they will take over egypt and install a true democracy with the brutal subjugation of women , stoning of adulterers and slaughter of all", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "Piers Morgan Tonight features guest host Donny Deutsch discussing Egypt's political transition with Tony Blair.", "prop_score_1": 0.5, "generate_explanation_1": "In this rewritten sentence, I used a more dynamic language to convey the excitement of the guest host's return.

'' More than 5,000 Syrian refugees have crossed the border and a U.N. refugee spokesman said the Red Crescent was preparing a fourth camp with room for 2,500 more . Witnesses said some 10,000 Syrians were sheltering near the border . The assault on Jisr al-Shughour , on a key road junction , is the latest action by armed forces to crush demands for political freedom and an end to oppression that pose an unprecedented challenge to President Bashar al-Assad 's 11-year rule . The main Syrian activist group organising protests said the crackdown had killed 1,300 civilians since February . Rights groups had previously put the toll at around 1,100 . Residents said most of Jisr al-Shughour 's 50,000 people had fled toward the Turkish border about 20 km -LRB- 12 miles -RRB- away , and tanks and helicopters had been shelling and machine-gunning the town . Syria has banned most foreign correspondents , making it difficult to verify accounts of events . It says the protests are part of a violent conspiracy backed by foreign powers to sow sectarian strife . `` Units of the Syrian Arab Army have taken total control of Jisr al-Shughour and are chasing remnants of the armed terrorist gangs in the woods and mountains , '' the Syrian news agency said . It said one soldier and two armed men had been killed in clashes around the town , and that that army units had defused explosives planted on bridges and roads . The agency said the forces had uncovered mass graves containing the bodies of 10 security men killed and buried by armed groups in Jisr al-Shughour . `` Most of them had had their heads and arms amputated with machetes , '' it said . Asked if there were clashes in the town , Mustapha , a 39-year-old mason who said he had fled to near the Turkish border early on Sunday , told Reuters by phone : `` What clashes ? The army is shelling the town from tanks . Everyone has been fleeing . `` Even if we did have guns , what are they going to do in front of artillery ? Syria is a tightly controlled dictatorship and all of a sudden the regime says Jisr al-Shughour is armed to the teeth . They are punishing us for wanting freedom . '' The government said last week that `` armed gangs '' had killed more than 120 security personnel in the town after large demonstrations there . Refugees and rights groups said the dead were civilians killed by security forces or soldiers who had been shot for refusing to fire on civilians . `` When the massacre happened in Jisr al-Shughour the army split , or they started fighting each other and blamed it on us , '' a woman refugee , who refused to give her name , told the Turkish news channel NTV on Saturday . A senior Western diplomat in Damascus told Reuters : `` The official version is improbable . Most people had left Jisr al-Shughour after seeing the regime 's scorched-earth policy , shelling and the heavy use of armor in the valley ... `` The refugee exodus into Turkey is continuing and the numbers are higher than those officially counted so far . '' Residents said the army unit attacking Jisr al-Shughour was commanded by Assad 's brother Maher and employing the tactics used in other centres to crush protests . The United States accused the Syrian government of creating a `` humanitarian crisis '' and urged it to halt its offensive and allow immediate access by the International Committee for the Red Cross to help refugees , detainees and the wounded . Turkey has provided camps for refugees and sent the wounded to hospitals , but restricted access to the refugees , saying this is to protect their privacy . In footage shot for Reuters by a Turkish youth on the Syrian side of the border , a few kilometres into Syria from Guvecci , exhausted and distressed looking Syrians waited in a cluster of tents and under makeshift shelters . The West and the United Nations have criticised Syria for not allowing international access to the wounded , the imprisoned and the refugees , but Russia and China have not backed any Security Council action to rein in Syria 's rulers . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . In its brutal response , the regime appears to be equally as desperate . This at a time when the U.N. and NATO are stretched to the limit and Russia and China are unwilling to act . It will become uglier and uglier . I am sure -LRB- ha . ha -RRB- that Mr. Cameron and Mr. Sarkozsy are up at this time after a sleepless night worrying about civilian deaths in Libya , reading the news on Reuters and wondering if they are in any way responsible for the Syrian mess . But of course they are not responsible , and I am sure that they are both appalled at the unfolding of events and regret that there is nothing that they can do about the situation . The massive propaganda effort that was launched to justify the intervention in Libya will have to be doubled now and the double-speak has to be ramped up , just to keep their little heads above water . But their heads will roll -LRB- politically speaking -RRB- , because their people are now going to realize that when you debase a noble ideal -LRB- saving innocent lives -RRB- by hypocritically using it to justify military action to promote narrow self-interests , then you create a situation where no one will care when that noble ideal is invoked again by you or anybody else . Morality in politics does matter . The Syrian President and both Cameron and Sarkozsy will soon learn that lesson . They will also learn that we are now living in the 21st . century and not the 19th . This whole uprising thing is ridiculous . First off , peaceful demonstrations should focus on labor stikes , shutdowns or sitins to get message out , not guns . Government should allow approved and controlled demonstrations and only use water cannons , tear gas or stun grenades if necessary to disperse unruly demonstrators . The idea is to PREVENT LOSS OF LIFE . Unfortuately , both sides need to get a grip -LRB- on reality and move towards negotiations that lead to reform . It would seem since the USA\\/Israel has been activity trying to destabilize Syria for decades with regime change & transfer of Golan Heights officially to Israel as their goal that any reports from so called human rights activists should be suspicious unless funding NGO identified & confirmed by international recognizes independent journalist . Unrest in Syria is regional with the majority of the nation carrying on normal daily activity and supporting the Assad government . This is unlike the national popular protests of other Arab nation , and actually appears to have more in common with Ukraine s Orange Revolution 2004 than Arab Spring . In the Orange revolution activist incited young university student in Kiev to protest elections the local unrest gain western media attention which to the surprise of the rest of the country lead to regime change , which was revoked by the people in the next general election . We really need to question all reports of brutality that are n't validated by respected independent reporters least they lead to false accusation as those aired by the BBC against Gaddafi indicating the ordering of mass rape & issuing the troops Viagra to assist in the act . Stories like that are meant to build popular support for continued bombardment leading to the invasion & occupation of Libya . After USA\\/EU once again going beyond the scope of UN Security Council Resolution ; using air attacks to aid rebels & impose regime change by any means , while refusing to sanction crimes against humanity of Israel , Bahrain , Yemen & Saudi Arabia it is unlikely that the USA , Israel & France will ever get Russia & China & a majority of the Security Council to approve any action against Syria or Iran . We are now actively attacking 5 sovereign nations therefore we are currently at war with 6 nations -LRB- N. Korea is only a cease fire so technically the USA is still at war -RRB- .

We look at the short and long-term priorities . The UN World Food Programme -LRB- WFP -RRB- has warned that while the relief effort in Haiti is beginning to gain its footing , providing food for more than two million people a day represents the most complex task it has ever faced . Relief agencies have tried to buy goods locally and regionally , but such efforts have been hampered because local markets affected by the earthquake have been slow to reopen , and Haiti 's subsistence farms have been unable to ramp up production . This has forced the WFP to use nearly all of its stores of high-energy biscuits and nutrient-rich meals which do not require water . Aid agencies will begin to distribute staple foods such as rice , beans , vegetable oil and salt - instead of just emergency ration packs - once cooking equipment has been distributed widely and safe water supplies have been established . There is an acute shortage of drinking water in areas affected by the earthquake . The water supply system , which before the disaster only provided 40 % of the population of Port-au-Prince with clean water , has effectively collapsed . Massive quantities of bottled water have had to be flown into Haiti Aid agencies are shipping in massive quantities of bottled water and distributing water purification tablets . Many people , however , have complained that they have received little , if any , of either . The rapid response phase is expected to last two months and will need to be followed by longer-term activities , such as providing reliable water supplies for rebuilt homes and new settlements . The main challenges are post-operative care and logistical support to the health facilities in terms of fuel and medical supplies , according to the UN humanitarian agency OCHA . Haiti 's ministry of health and the World Health Organization -LRB- WHO -RRB- is revising its emergency response strategy and will gradually shift the focus from emergency surgical cases to primary health care . `` Priorities are changing , and there is more need for post-operative care and follow-up . But there is still little capacity to help patients who need that follow-up care , '' WHO Director Dr Mirta Roses said on 25 January . Among the most urgent needs are those of thousands of Haitians who had amputations as a result of injuries . `` These people will need physical rehabilitation as well as mental health services . That means more nursing and mental health personnel and more physical therapists , and of course the right equipment for these kinds of programs , '' said Dr Roses . Among the most urgent cases are the thousands of Haitians who lost limbs Doctors fear many amputees will languish or even die without proper rehabilitation . As the emergency phase of the disaster winds down , there is a pressing need for mobile and community-based clinics that can provide such services as maternity care , post-operative care , and treatment for chronic health problems including diabetes , heart disease , HIV , and tuberculosis , the WHO says . Forty-three of the 59 hospitals , are now functioning , but they are having difficulty meeting the demand for health services , especially as the emergency medical personnel who arrived after the earthquake head home . Also important is establishing surveillance networks to detect outbreaks of communicable diseases , a significant threat at the makeshift camps . The International Organisation for Migration -LRB- IOM -RRB- says work is under way to improve the living conditions of the estimated 692,000 people in makeshift shelters in 591 camps in Port-au-Prince , until more durable solutions are found . More than 235,000 people have taken advantage of the Haitian government 's offer of free transportation to cities in the north and south-west . The IOM estimates that 100,000 family-sized tents are needed urgently Although the IOM had 10,000 tents stored in Haiti before the earthquake and has a further 30,000 abroad that will arrive soon , it says `` the supply is unlikely to address the extensive shelter needs '' . The UN agency estimates that 100,000 family-sized tents are needed to house about 500,000 people , but the UN says up to one million require shelter . Meanwhile , work has begun at the sites identified by the Haitian government for the establishment of organised tented settlements . It is estimated that each settlement will accommodate up to 10,000 people . However , tents can not be set up and displaced people relocated at the sites until they have water and sanitation facilities . Tent settlements can only provide a short-term solution , officials say , particularly with the hurricane season expected to start around June . Haiti is likely to need billions of dollars to build new homes and government buildings in Port-au-Prince and the surrounding area , which were densely-populated before the earthquake . Many of the buildings that collapsed were poorly designed and built - mostly with concrete and often without steel reinforcement and foundations . There is a clear need for higher technical standards to be used during reconstruction . Many of the buildings that collapsed were poorly designed and built But Haiti 's government , along with many planning and architectural experts , have also called for a new strategy that will help Haiti build for the future , including reducing Port-au-Prince 's population density and replacing slums on unstable hillsides with homes that are safe , affordable and sustainable . A new comprehensive building code that complies with international construction standards will be a priority . Cletus Springer , the director of sustainable development at the Organisation of American States , said that for this to happen the authorities would have to work with the private sector and banks to help low-income families . `` Because of the poverty levels , not everybody 's going to be able to build to the exacting standards that a building code would require , '' he said . In the short-term , the United Nations Human Settlements Programme -LRB- UN-Habitat -RRB- is carrying out a rapid structural damage estimate of buildings in the affected area . Jean Yves Barcelo , the agency 's adviser in Haiti , hopes it will start planning for new settlements and at the neighborhood level within a week or two . Experts warn that desperate residents of the poorer areas of Port-au-Prince may begin informal and unregulated reconstruction before a long-term reconstruction plan can be instigated . The lack of investment in Haiti 's rural economy over the past three decades has led to an average of 75,000 people moving to the capital , Port-au-Prince , every year . Since 1982 , the city 's population has grown from 750,000 to more than 2.5 million . The rapid expansion was not planned and resulted in overcrowding , inadequate infrastructure , and the proliferation of slums containing scores of poorly-built homes , many of which were destroyed by the earthquake . Haiti 's ambassador to the US envisages a smaller , better-built Port-au-Prince Key official buildings - the presidential palace , parliament building , police headquarters and 13 of the government 's 15 ministries - were also destroyed . Many experts say that Port-au-Prince should be reduced in size when rebuilt , and Haiti 's economic and government activities decentralised . Some have even suggested relocating the capital altogether . Hundreds of thousands of people have already left the city for tented settlements or family homes in other parts of Haiti . Many say they should be persuaded to stay . Experts warn , however , that mass-relocation schemes after other disasters have usually failed because they isolate people from the jobs and economic opportunity that drew them to the city in the first place . While the main airport in Port-au-Prince was not put out of action by the disaster , it was not equipped to deal with the volume of flights required by the relief effort . The US military has taken over control of the airport To speed up the process , the US military took over control of the airport and 160 planes a day are currently able to land . Aid flights are also coming into and out of the Dominican Republic and several other regional airports in Haiti . Port-au-Prince 's main port was also badly damaged and other ports in the area could only accept smaller vessels . One of the two piers in the capital 's docks was recently reopened by the US Navy , allowing bulkier shipments to be delivered by sea . At present , 150 containers can be unloaded a day", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "The government and international officials in Haiti are developing a strategy to rebuild the long-impoverished country while continuing to provide emergency aid to hundreds of thousands of survivors left homeless.

CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Hi , I 'm Carl Azuz , and you 're tuned in to CNN Student News ! A country in chaos ; the Midwest bracing for a blizzard : 10 minutes of commercial-free headlines start right now . AZUZ : Protesters ignoring a government curfew ; armed troops patrolling the streets ; daily supplies running low . In a word , chaos . For more than a week , people have been marching through the streets of Egypt , calling for long-time President Hosni Mubarak to step down . Some experts think this past week of protests could just be the calm before the storm . There are reports that Egyptians are planning another wave of massive protests starting today in some of the nation 's major cities , like Cairo and Alexandria . The Egyptian military has been called out to try to control the situation . Yesterday , a military spokesman said the army wo n't use violence against the protesters , the troops are just there to help maintain security . There have been times when protesters fought with security forces in the streets . We 've gotten reports that more than 100 people have been killed in the violence , though it 's hard to confirm those kinds of numbers in a situation like this . Egyptians who are n't part of the protests are being affected , too . Parts of the country are running low on things they need , like food and gas . And with police and security forces focused on the protests , some shops and businesses have been robbed , and there are reports of prison breaks . As you can imagine , a lot of people are trying to get out , especially citizens of other countries who live or work in Egypt . The U.S. State Department says there are more than 50,000 Americans in Egypt . The agency 's working to arrange transportation out of the country for those folks . But as we heard from one American , finding a way to leave can be very frustrating . LAURA MURPHY LEE , AMERICAN TOURIST IN EGYPT : You can not get away by water . You can not take public transportation because it 's been deemed unsafe , and you can not fly . You can not take public transportation because it 's been deemed unsafe . `` There have been no arrests , '' The Prime Minister of Egypt , Omar Suleiman , told CNN . But those of us who are not in Cairo or Alexandria , are trapped right now . AZUZ : There 's another aspect to what 's going on in Egypt , and it has to do with oil . Egypt is n't a major oil producer , but four-and-a-half percent of the entire world 's oil supply has to go through Egypt . Stephanie Elam is here to help explain what kind of impact it might have if that flow of oil runs into any problems . STEPHANIE ELAM , CNN BUSINESS CORRESPONDENT : This is something that I know is like a world away for most Americans , but it could really have been an impact . And what we want to do is demonstrate for you just how key this region is , because you 've got the Suez Canal there , which is in Egypt . It 's controlled by Egypt . And there 's also the Sumed pipeline . So , let 's take a look first at the Suez Canal . You can see right there that in 2009 , we know 1.8 million barrels a day flowed through the canal . You also have the Sumed pipeline , which is just to the west of the Suez Canal . And through there , 1.1 million barrels a day actually flow through that pipeline . So this artery , these two arteries , are just key for the region , because without this , what shippers would actually have to do is ship it all the way around Africa to get it over to Europe . And that would add 6,000 miles to the journey . No doubt about it , a -RRB- that would cost a lot more . And b -RRB- it would also mess up with some supply and demand on when it would actually show up in Europe and the rest of the world that needs to get this key oil from such an important , oil-producing region . AZUZ : Taking you back to the U.S. now , where it has been a pretty rough winter so far . We 've seen brutal snowstorms . Do n't even get me started talking about the airport . There 've been hundreds of canceled and delayed flights . And here we go again . A major storm system is developing across the country . Yesterday afternoon , Rob Marciano was tracking which parts of the U.S. could be affected and just how bad this might get . ROB MARCIANO , CNN WEATHER ANCHOR : There 's over 20 states that are within a winter storm watch or advisory or winter storm warning , from New England all the way to New Mexico . This is a huge system that 's going to affect tens of millions of people ; pretty much 3\\/4 of the country is under the gun here . And if you 're not in one of these winter weather advisories , you 're in the Southeast , which has had the heat built up for the past couple days , so there 's going to be some energy there for severe thunderstorms also . Winter storm warnings now posted for St. Louis back to Oklahoma City . We could see anywhere from eight to 12 inches of snow down here . Up to Chicago , could see 12 to 18 inches of snow . That is unbelievable for Chicago . And if that happens , if that verifies , we get 18 to 20 inches of snow , it 's going to be the worst snowstorm they 've seen in over ten years . AZUZ : February first : On this day in history in 1790 , the U.S. Supreme Court met for the first time in New York City . In 1865 , President Abraham Lincoln signed a resolution sending the 13th Amendment , which would abolish slavery , to the states for ratification . In 1960 , four African-Americans began a sit-in protest at a lunch counter in Greensboro , North Carolina after they were n't given service because of the store 's `` whites only '' policy . And in 2003 , the space shuttle Columbia broke up while re-entering the earth 's atmosphere , killing all seven crew members on board .

A lot of the militant Taliban activity you hear about is here in the tribal region just west of us , and this is Afghanistan . We came here to tell you the story of Rukhsana Batool .

Elementary schools opened last week . The university will open next month . Water and electricity are flowing . Uniformed police are on the street . Trash collection is haphazard but functioning . This is the fastest post-war recovery I have witnessed : faster than Bosnia , Kosovo , Iraq or Afghanistan . Certainly faster than Somalia , Sierra Leone or Rwanda . Why this rapid recovery in a country marked by four decades of dictatorship ? Why does Libya seem on track while Egypt seems to have gone off the rails ? When I went to Dresden in 1992 , scars from WWII were still visible even after 40 years of the Allied carpet bombing . -LRB- scandalous events that never took place in Libya -RRB- There is no electricity , water is scarce , Tripoli is in ruins , people are dying.i tional Council -LRB- NTC -RRB- , is uncorrupted and uninterested in continuing in power . He has pledged not to seek future office . He has visited the liberated cities to celebrate the single goal of freeing Libya from the Qaddafi regime . The NTC has replaced Qaddafi s green flag with the red , black and green banner emblazoned with the star and crescent that was Libya s flag at independence . The revolution in Libya was not interested in compromise or a managed transition . It wanted a clean break : Qaddafi out and a new , more democratic regime , in . The NTC and a clandestine Tripoli local council planned carefully for the military takeover of Tripoli and the restoration of services in the aftermath . With three hundred mosques playing CDs chanting Allahu akbar ! Qaddafi s forces on the evening of August 20 found themselves confused and then attacked from both inside and outside the city , which fell far more easily than anticipated . In the weeks since , the new , unpaid local administration has achieved a great deal . It sent technicians hundreds of kilometers to the south with support from local tribesmen to reactivate the wells that pump water into Qaddafi s Great Man-made River , which supplies Tripoli and other population centers . The national government is making the usual social welfare payments . Flour and oil subsidies have been maintained , so bread is cheap and available . Only partial withdrawal of salaries from banks is permitted , but Libyans are confident about the country s economic future , based on its oil and gas resources . Libyans know what to expect next . The NTC has promised elections for an interim assembly by April 2012 and presidential elections by April 2013 . It has published a constitutional framework that establishes Libya as both Islamic and democratic . The contrast with Egypt , where I spent a week earlier this month , is striking . Egypt is a much larger , more complicated and poorer country . There unity around the demand for President Hosni Mubarak s resignation deteriorated quickly once he resigned . Little planning had been done . The protesters asked the army to take over . Unprepared , it had to postpone elections even as the protest movement split , with secularists demanding a constitution , or at least constitutional principles , before elections and Islamists preferring it the other way around . Egyptians now do not know what to expect , though the first round of elections is now promised for November . Some of the protesters have now targeted Israel , diverting attention from Egypt s own problems and scaring off European and American tourists . The economy is in a nose dive . Resources are highly constrained . Things could go wrong in Libya . We are still in the early days . Qaddafi s forces could go underground and conduct the kind of insurgency that Saddam Hussein s secret services ignited in Iraq . Fighting could erupt among the many militias that constitute the NTC s military forces . Many of them came from outside Tripoli . They may refuse to go home or to disarm . Is the author of this article reporting from the Quatari sound stage where some of the Libyan press propaganda was filmed ? -LRB- events that never took place in Libya -RRB- There is no electricity , water is scarce , Tripoli is in ruins , people are dying . There is gunfire and daily skirmishes . When you carpet bomb a City it takes decades to rebuild it . When I went to Dresden in 1992 , scars from WWII were still visible even after 40 years of the Allied carpet bombing . I suspect that Mr Serwer has never been to Libya or even in Africa : `` Trash collection is haphazard but functioning . '' Without being facetious , there is no trash collecting in most African countries . People throw rubbish all over the place . As long it is not in the way , it stays there until decomposes . Dead donkeys , coke bottles , masonry . `` This is the fastest post-war recovery I have witnessed '' I am not sure if the author is aware that Libya is still at war . The rebels are blowing up houses belonging to Ghaddafi supporters . Civil war is brewing . Since you think all is well in Tripoli , why do n't you go there on a holiday with your family to collect landmines ? Another delusional article from Reuters ... This article is pure propaganda and fabricated reality . Tripoli is in absolute shambles . The TNC does not command the mob of rebels much less Libyan society . Reuters is busy fabricating a virtual reality instead of providing news on the ground . Now this is what I call propaganda , what a weak article . Really , do you really believe people buy in to this garbage ? why are we crazy about exporting democracy to people in stone age ? reuters sucks ... Weak article ... The idea is to make people believe that is everything ok in lybia when the reality is completly different . Comparison with Egypt is even worse . They will never mention that the western powers support the military junta and the delay of a real democracy there since most of the egyptians are against Israel . So sad ... I really expected more from Reuters . in reality Libya WAS ! one of the most advanced nations in Africa\\/Arab world , after NTC and NATO ? how many years has it been sent back ? how do you know if the NTC wants democracy ? they are full of ex members of the LIFG . and other Islamist groups . what do you really know about them ? The war in Libya did not start with the USA or NATO bombing , it started with Gaddafi bombing his own people and Libyan cities . I have been to Libya and am traveling to Tripoli again on Tuesday . The speed with which the country is coming together in the aftermath of the war is truly amazing . There are still pockets of resistance in a couple of towns , but overall , Libya will be entirely freed from the captive of Gaddafi and his regime . Libya will not submit to any foreign intervention and will create its own democratic state . The rebuilding of Libya will be quick and effective . The people of Libya are determined not to repeat the lessons they have learned from the 41 of Gaddafi rule . Those who believe Libya was one of the most advanced nations in Africa prior to 17 February revolution should get their heads out of the sand and visit the many deprived towns and cities in Libya where people are still living in shacks after 41 years of the Gaddafi rule and where the average Libyan salary was no more than $ 200 per month !

CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : It is the very last day of January , but the very first day of a new week of CNN Student News ! I 'm Carl Azuz . If you took a look at the news at all this weekend , you probably know what our top story today is . The world is watching as a political crisis engulfs the north African nation . Protesters have been marching through the streets for days . They 're speaking out against the Egyptian government , and specifically against long-time President Hosni Mubarak . The protesters say they have two demands . One : They want President Mubarak to leave office and to be put on trial . Two : They want to change the country 's constitution . The government has been trying different ways to get these protests under control . It 's established a curfew ; it 's sent out fighter jets and thousands of security troops . As you can see , it does n't seem to be making any difference . The protests lasted through Sunday night and looked like they could keep going for a while . In different cities around the world , other people are holding rallies in support of Egypt 's protesters . Businesses and governments that have offices in Egypt are working to evacuate their citizens and clients from the country . President Mubarak went on TV over the weekend to talk to the people of Egypt . He said he understands why they 're upset , including their concerns over alleged government corruption and desire for better living conditions . Mubarak asked his government ministers to resign , but said he plans to say in power . But that 's not enough for the man you see here : Mohamed ElBaradei , a prominent Egyptian and holder of a Nobel Peace Prize . He 's a leader of the largest group that 's against President Mubarak . And on Sunday , he urged the Egyptian president to `` leave today and save the country . '' ElBaradei says the push for Mubarak to step down is `` non-negotiable . '' AZUZ : All right , we 're gonna talk about some of the major players in all of this in today 's Breakdown . First off , Egypt 's leader , Hosni Mubarak . He 's been the country 's president since 1981 . Egypt 's president serves six-year terms with no term limits , which is why he 's been in power so long . The country is a republic , with the president chosen by popular vote . But here 's the kicker : Until 2005 , Mubarak was the only candidate on the ballot ! In 2005 , Mubarak beat out a couple other candidates when he got almost 90 percent of the vote . Another election is scheduled for later this year . The country Mubarak leads has 80 million people ; it is the largest population in the Arab world . And that 's put a strain on the government because many of the people feel it 's unable to meet their demands . 20 percent of Egypt 's population lives below the poverty line . And one more point , here : the Muslim Brotherhood . This is a group that 's been very vocal in encouraging people to protest . And it 's technically illegal ! Egypt 's constitution does not allow religion-based political parties . But the Muslim Brotherhood has been somewhat tolerated by President Mubarak . I say `` somewhat '' because members are allowed to run in local elections , but they 're not allowed to have seats in the country 's government . Now , I 'm gonna turn it over to Don Lothian to show you why what happens in Egypt is so important to the United States , as well as countries near Egypt in the Middle East . DAN LOTHIAN , CNN WHITE HOUSE CORRESPONDENT : As tensions rise in Egypt , the White House is ramping up its response . U.S. PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA : When President Mubarak addressed the Egyptian people , he pledged a better democracy and greater economic opportunity . I just spoke to him after his speech , and I told him he has a responsibility to give meaning to those words , to take concrete steps and actions that deliver on that promise . LOTHIAN : Secretary of State Hillary Clinton weighed in too , voicing concerns over the violence directed at protestors by police and security forces . U.S. SECRETARY OF STATE HILLARY CLINTON : We urge the Egyptian authorities to allow peaceful protests and to reverse the unprecedented steps it has taken to cut off communications . LOTHIAN : The Obama administration has been pushing President Hosni Mubarak privately and publicly to implement reforms . A delicate dance as cables released by Wikileaks revealed . In a 2009 dispatch over concerns about human rights abuses , U.S. Ambassador Margaret Scobey is reported to have written , `` Mubarak takes this issue personally and it makes him seethe when we raise it , particularly in public . '' U.S. officials have also resisted calling for regime change . JON ALTERMAN , CENTER FOR STRATEGIC AND INTERNATIONAL STUDIES : I think the administration is going to try to appeal to the best instincts , and ultimately will work with whoever is in power in Egypt . PROTESTERS : Hey Hey ! Mubarak has to go ! LOTHIAN : Even so , outside the White House , pressure from protesters looking for change . Egypt has been a key U.S. ally for years , working to bring Israelis and Palestinians together , being a stable partner in the region , and supporting the international effort to reign in Iran 's nuclear ambitions . ROBERT GIBBS , WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY : And that 's important , but there is a responsibility that is had by the government of Egypt , regardless of the role that they have played internationally or regionally , over the course of any number of years . They also have to address the grievances that have built up for those same number of years within the country of Egypt . LOTHIAN : Officials here at the White House are also discussing the assistance that the U.S. gives to Egypt , including more than a billion dollars each year . They 'll be reviewing over the next few days how the government deals with unrest on the ground and how that might impact that aid . Dan Lothian , CNN , the White House . TOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Today 's Shoutout goes out to Mrs. Barnes ' and Mrs. Rumbarger 's STEM classes at Petal High School in Petal , Mississippi ! What U.S. government program provides money to retired workers ? Is it : A -RRB- HUD , B -RRB- Social Security , C -RRB- CDC or D -RRB- Peace Corps ? You 've got three seconds -- GO ! The Social Security program gives money to Americans who are retired , disabled or in need . That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout ! AZUZ : It was 71 years ago today that the first Social Security check was issued ! The person who got it ? Her name was Ida Fuller ; she received a check from the government for $ 22.54 . During the two years before that , Fuller had paid money into the system . That 's how Social Security was designed to work : People who are working pay money in ; people who are retired get money out . If any of you have jobs , you 're part of this , too . There 's a line on your paycheck for how much money is taken out for Social Security . But there 's a lot of debate around Social Security and concerns that this fund might run out some day , and maybe in the not-too-distant future . People are living longer than they used to , so they 're getting more money from Social Security . And by the time people who are currently putting money into the system are old enough to take money out , there might not be anything left for them . AZUZ : Now personally , I write in cursive when I 'm taking notes , because that 's what I learned in school . But I also know how to type , too , and I learned that as well . What we 're asking on today 's blog is : Do you think it 's important to preserve the old-school cursive , or should schools focus on", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "The world is watching as a political crisis engulfs the north African nation...", "prop_score_1": 0.5, "generate_explanation_1": "In this sentence, the phrase \"The world is watching\" is a bit generic and doesn't add much to the sentence.

If you missed it , here 's what you need to know from the speech -- all in `` just '' 1,350 words . \\*\\* please note : this is an edited down version of the president 's speech , as prepared for delivery \\*\\* Good evening . Tonight , I d like to update the American people on the international effort that we have led in Libya what we have done , what we plan to do , and why this matters to us Mindful of the risks and costs of military action , we are naturally reluctant to use force to solve the world s many challenges . But when our interests and values are at stake , we have a responsibility to act . That is what happened in Libya over the course of these last six weeks . For more than four decades , the Libyan people have been ruled by a tyrant Moammar Gaddafi . He has denied his people freedom , exploited their wealth , murdered opponents at home and abroad , and terrorized innocent people around the world including Americans who were killed by Libyan agents . Last month , Gaddafi s grip of fear appeared to give way to the promise of freedom . In cities and towns across the country , Libyans took to the streets to claim their basic human rights . Faced with this opposition , Gaddafi began attacking his people . Ten days ago , having tried to end the violence without using force , the international community offered Gaddafi a final chance to stop his campaign of killing , or face the consequences . Rather than stand down , his forces continued their advance , bearing down on the city of Benghazi At this point , the United States and the world faced a choice We knew that if we waited one more day , Benghazi a city nearly the size of Charlotte could suffer a massacre that would have reverberated across the region and stained the conscience of the world . It was not in our national interest to let that happen . I refused to let that happen . And so nine days ago , after consulting the bipartisan leadership of Congress , I authorized military action to stop the killing and enforce UN Security Council Resolution 1973 . We struck regime forces approaching Benghazi to save that city and the people within it And tonight , I can report that we have stopped Gaddafi s deadly advance . To summarize , then : in just one month , the United States has worked with our international partners to mobilize a broad coalition , secure an international mandate to protect civilians , stop an advancing army , prevent a massacre , and establish a No Fly Zone with our allies and partners . To lend some perspective on how rapidly this military and diplomatic response came together , when people were being brutalized in Bosnia in the 1990s , it took the international community more than a year to intervene with air power to protect civilians . Moreover , we have accomplished these objectives consistent with the pledge that I made to the American people at the outset of our military operations . I said that America s role would be limited ; that we would not put ground troops into Libya ; that we would focus our unique capabilities on the front end of the operation , and that we would transfer responsibility to our allies and partners . Tonight , we are fulfilling that pledge . Our most effective alliance , NATO , has taken command of the enforcement of the arms embargo and No Fly Zone . Last night , NATO decided to take on the additional responsibility of protecting Libyan civilians . This transfer from the United States to NATO will take place on Wednesday . In that effort , the United States will play a supporting role . . Because of this transition . the risk and cost of this operation to our military , and to American taxpayers will be reduced significantly . Despite the success of our efforts over the past week , I know that some Americans continue to have questions about our efforts in Libya . Gaddafi has not yet stepped down from power , and until he does , Libya will remain dangerous . Moreover , even after Gaddafi does leave power , forty years of tyranny has left Libya fractured and without strong civil institutions . The transition to a legitimate government that is responsive to the Libyan people will be a difficult task . And while the United States will do our part to help , it will be a task for the international community , and more importantly a task for the Libyan people themselves . In fact , much of the debate in Washington has put forward a false choice when it comes to Libya . On the one hand , some question why America should intervene at all even in limited ways in this distant land . It is true that America can not use our military wherever repression occurs . And given the costs and risks of intervention , we must always measure our interests against the need for action . But that can not be an argument for never acting on behalf of what s right . In this particular country Libya ; at this particular moment , we were faced with the prospect of violence on a horrific scale . Some nations may be able to turn a blind eye to atrocities in other countries . The United States of America is different . And as President , I refused to wait for the images of slaughter and mass graves before taking action . Now , just as there are those who have argued against intervention in Libya , there are others who have suggested that we broaden our military mission beyond the task of protecting the Libyan people , and do whatever it takes to bring down Gaddafi and usher in a new government . Of course , there is no question that Libya and the world will be better off with Gaddafi out of power . I , along with many other world leaders , have embraced that goal , and will actively pursue it through non-military means . But broadening our military mission to include regime change would be a mistake If we tried to overthrow Gaddafi by force , our coalition would splinter . We would likely have to put U.S. troops on the ground , or risk killing many civilians from the air . The dangers faced by our men and women in uniform would be far greater . So would the costs , and our share of the responsibility for what comes next . To be blunt , we went down that road in Iraq . Thanks to the extraordinary sacrifices of our troops and the determination of our diplomats , we are hopeful about Iraq s future . But regime change there took eight years , thousands of American and Iraqi lives , and nearly a trillion dollars . That is not something we can afford to repeat in Libya . As Commander-in-Chief , I have no greater responsibility than keeping this country safe . And no decision weighs on me more than when to deploy our men and women in uniform . There will be times , though , when our safety is not directly threatened , but our interests and values are In such cases , we should not be afraid to act but the burden of action should not be America s alone . As we have in Libya , our task is instead to mobilize the international community for collective action . Because contrary to the claims of some , American leadership is not simply a matter of going it alone and bearing all of the burden ourselves . Real leadership creates the conditions and coalitions for others to step up as well ; to work with allies and partners so that they bear their share of the burden and pay their share of the costs ; and to see that the principles of justice and human dignity are upheld by all . My fellow Americans , I know that at a time of upheaval overseas when the news is filled with conflict and change it can be tempting to turn away from the world . But let us also remember that for generations , we have done the hard work of protecting our own people , as well as millions around the globe .

Bush 's presidency ? Bob Woodward and Barton Gellman explore the most significant events of the Bush-Cheney years -- from the Iraq war and waterboarding , to Hurricane Katrina and the financial meltdown -- in a roundtable discussion with Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson . Watch the full video interview , or click through the transcript at right to view segments by topic . Bob , you have written three books now about the Bush administration ... WOODWARD : And my wife says if there 's a fifth she 's gonna shoot me . -LRB- Laughter -RRB- ROBINSON : Obviously there 's something that fascinates you about this administration . So what do you think is the one thing George Bush is going to be remembered for ? WOODWARD : Well , I think he 's going to be remembered for lots of things . The defining event is the Iraq war , because that was a war of choice . As we know that war is not over , 146,000 troops there , almost the same number of civilian contractors . It is a massive land army in presence in the heart of the Middle East . Gen. Petraeus is keeping that large force there because he knows its not over , it 's not stabilized . Ah , Bush of course hopes that that 's going to turn out well and there is an outside chance it 's possible and he 'll be Harry Truman . It 's also possible that its ' going to , and the preponderance of the evidence is , that it may not turn out well . And , so , but you know the financial crisis is a giant legacy , and I 'm wondering what the financial crisis is going to be called . Is it going to be called Wall Street-gate , Capitalism-gate , ah , Bush-gate , Cheney-gate ? ROBINSON : Since you are responsible for the original gate , we 're not going to call it a gate at all , -LRB- laughter -RRB- we 're going to call it the financial crisis . We 'll get , we 'll get back to Iraq I 'm sure . But I want to ask Bart . Bart , your book Angler is the definitive look at Dick Cheney and so I want to ask you the same question . What is the one thing Dick Cheney is going to be remembered for ? BART GELLMAN : I think Dick Cheney is going to be remembered for his attempt to expand the powers of the executive and the presidency and for his overreach on that front and for the backlash that came against him . ROBINSON : Was he indeed a uniquely powerful vice president ? GELLMAN : He clearly was uniquely powerful as vice president . I think in the modern era he 's the most powerful person who 's ever held high office who was not president . He 's the nearest thing I guess you could say to the deputy president we 've ever had . 3 -RRB- The Roots of War ROBINSON : You know Bob , I would tend to agree , just in general , that Iraq is probably the headline of the Bush-Cheney administration . So take me back . Where was the germ for Iraq really laid ? Does it come out of the first Gulf War ? Does it come out of 9\\/11 ? Where does it come from ? WOODWARD : Well , it comes from like all historical causation a convergence of events . 9\\/11 was significant , changed the world . I agree with Bart that Cheney was such a presence after 9\\/11 , such a steamroller for the offensive mode that became really the Bush doctrine . That it was in the chronology from 9\\/11 until they launched the Iraq war , the war plan looked easier . So it was going to be quick , as Cheney with great intensity said , we 're going to be welcomed with sweets and flowers . There was a sense that we had to do something . There was a sense that was valid that Saddam was a bad actor . But when you look back on that , and study it and study particularly the neglect and the failure to manage the aftermath , it 's hard to look at it as a good thing . ROBINSON : Bart , how do you see Dick Cheney 's role in the run-up to the Iraq War , indeed , in the decision to go to war in Iraq . GELLMAN : His role , and in fact his chief of staff 's Scooter Libby 's role , were very important . I like what Bob said about convergence . I think that George Bush and Dick Cheney sort of came to the gates of Baghdad by way of two very different paths , and they converged on the same point of view and the same decision . Cheney saw this in much more sort of classical security and balance of power terms . He wanted to send a message . Some of his staff told me , and this was something we did n't know before , that he was looking for a demonstration effect . The idea you sort of knock one bad guy down to send a message to others . He was actually more worried about North Korea and Iran as constituting this nexus he always talked about between hostile state , WMD and terrorists who would use them . But those were not attractive military options , and he hoped to deter them with this kind of war . I mean , the other surprising thing that we did n't know before , is that despite his public comments , Cheney was quite ambivalent about the war . He thought it was a close call . Once he made the call , and once the president made the call more importantly , he would go and make it a 100 percent case in public . But he was worried it would n't turn out well . WOODWARD : And the other factor here is the mind of George Bush . In one interview , he told me , I believe we have a duty to free people , to liberate people . And that liberation , the freedom agenda , was a giant driver . You had the support , the encouragement of Cheney , the intelligence community saying Saddam has weapons of mass destruction . And Bush looked at this , ah , as an opportunity . And I think when he stood on the deck of the aircraft carrier with the well-remembered sign mission accomplished , he had that sense . They 've done it , they 've really pulled something off that was going to be important . I 've reached the conclusion , I never kind of questioned Bush 's sincerity . I think he really wanted to do the right thing . The problem is , and this if you 're looking for a theme in all of this , it juxtaposes very dramatically with Cheney . Bush does n't like homework , whereas Cheney - ROBINSON : Right , he does all his homework , does n't he - WOODWARD : Cheney is all homework , is all homework and he knows how to marshal arguments and evidence . And so after the appearance on the aircraft carrier was that sense , `` Oh , we 've done it . '' And of course on the ground in Iraq is the intelligence people who were telling Bush and Cheney both , `` This is turning into a catastrophe . '' And they did n't wake up for really years . Your Opinion : Was Bush right to order the Iraq War ? ROBINSON : In terms of deciding to go to war in Iraq and also how to prosecute the war , I do wonder what impact 9\\/11 had on the mindset of each man . I ask because I 've been talking to another of the principals who was in and around the White House that day , and I once in a conversation I said , um , something to the effect , I know what it must have been like in the administration that day . And this person said , `` No you do n't . You have no idea what it felt like , the feeling that we had missed something , the feeling that we were under attack , the feeling that we had to do everything we could to avoid another attack .

But , as Richard Norton-Taylor discovers , the lawyer is used to controversy Tuesday 1 February 2005 00.01 GMT Mention his name and the Ministry of Defense shudders . He is the target of death threats . An investigation was launched into his activities after he was viciously attacked in the pages of the Daily Mail . The inquiry is being carried out by the Legal Services Commission , the body which oversees legal aid - the same organization that subsequently welcomed one of his high court victories as `` historic '' . In 2004 , Shiner was named one of Britain 's `` outstanding human rights lawyers ' honorary ' . He received the award for `` outstanding skill and tenacity in taking test cases to protect the rights of Iraqi civilians tortured and killed by British forces '' . He was also praised for his `` personal sacrifice and professional dedication in fighting for justice and individual rights '' . Phil Shiner , on whom praise and blame , it seems , is heaped almost in equal measure , is not afraid to court controversy . Just as well , given the causes he has taken up , ranging from the rights of former Gurkha soldiers to the wrongs of nuclear weapons . He set up his Birmingham-based law firm , Public Interest Lawyers , in 1999 after a spell in private practice concentrating on environmental law . One of his earliest cases , he remembers , was against Edwina Currie . She was then a Conservative member of Birmingham city council . Shiner was , he says , a `` fresh-faced idealistic member of Small Heath law center '' . She was pushing forward what he calls a `` punishment block '' for what were considered the worst tenants . He took the case to the high court , forcing the council to demolish the flats . Shiner , 48 , was educated at Bishop Ullathorne Roman Catholic comprehensive school in Coventry . Last week , he returned there to give a talk to the sixth form , encouraging the pupils , he says , to believe in themselves and to go places . So what drives him ? `` Throughout my life , I have always been a passionate believer in social justice . It comes from my Catholic upbringing . '' He goes on retreat to Iona every year and he has always been a socialist , he says . `` Socialism and Catholicism go hand in hand . '' Is n't the title Public Interest Lawyers - the firm has just six employees , including three solicitors - a bit presumptuous ? Shiner replies that he is not out to define the public interest ; rather , to make the point that there is a strong public-interest component to the cases - and causes - he takes on . For many human rights lawyers , a lot of the issues he tackles are pretty unfashionable . Take some of his environmental cases . They include damage done by incinerators burning hazardous or dangerous substances , landfills , open-cast coal schemes , quarries , chemical plants , inappropriately sited mobile-phone masts , and industrial or commercial developments on greenfield land . `` Litigation through judicial review is a relatively blunt instrument , '' says his firm 's website . `` We aim for a preventative approach to these polluting developments . We are not personal injury lawyers who act to sue for damages once a project has caused harm to public health and the environment . '' It continues : `` PIL try to take pre-emptive action , that is , to make representations to a decision-maker prior to a decision being made , say , to grant planning permission for a particular project . In that way we feed our legal representations into the broader political process so that an authority might be persuaded not to grant consent at all . For example , if an incinerator is unacceptable to the local community because of the increased levels of prescribed pollutants , it is better to persuade a local planning authority of that than expect a judge on judicial review to enter the debate as to whether that is or is not acceptable . Many of our successes have been in persuading public bodies to refuse consent for polluting projects so that , once the developer decides not to appeal , the community can close the book on the problem . '' Shiner also takes on nuclear power - every aspect of it . Tomorrow , he is appealing against the refusal of legal aid for a case to decide whether the nuclear weapons facility at Faslane in Scotland should abide by the Radioactive Substances Act , an issue , he says , which is important for the local community . The nuclear weapons plant at Aldermaston in Berkshire , and the naval dockyard at Devonport , the navy 's nuclear submarine base , should also be subject to extra safeguards , he says . He is taking comfort from the decision by the European Commission to seek a ruling from the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg that health and safety rules should apply to military as well as civil sites . Shiner has pursued equally strenuously the issue of the legality of nuclear weapons and Britain 's special nuclear weapons relationship with the United States . He acted for CND - with Rabinder Singh QC , a founding member of Matrix barristers ' chambers with Tony Blair 's wife , Cherie Booth QC - in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade the high court to rule on whether the invasion of Iraq was legal . He believes the use of cluster bombs is an issue that should be heard by the International Criminal Court . And he is now preparing a case on behalf of Quakers and others , arguing that they should not have to pay the part of their taxes which is spent on armaments and warfare . Unsurprisingly , he is not the most Ministry of Defense 's most popular lawyer . Last year , he threatened a judicial review of the prime minister 's decision to give ex-Gurkhas the right of abode in Britain , but only those who had recently left the regiment . The government gave way and Geoff Hoon , the defense secretary , has now announced a full review of the terms and conditions of service of all Gurkhas . It is not the first time that Shiner has taken up the Gurkhas ' cause . He says one of his high points is winning the argument , in the high court and then the court of appeal , that ex-Gurkhas captured by the Japanese should be given a # 10,000 ex gratia payment on a par with other armed services inmates of the wartime concentration camps . Some 1,000 Gurkhas and their families benefited . A `` low moment '' was his decision to seek evidence from Iraqi families whose relatives , allegedly , had been killed , mistreated or even tortured by British troops in southern Iraq after the last Iraq war was declared over . The high-profile case provoked huge controversy . `` Anyone Else Want to Sue ? '' the Daily Mail asked last year in a banner headline . '' ` Murder ' Slur on Our Soldiers '' , it declared , adding : `` Solicitor who yesterday accused British troops of murder went touting for clients in Iraq - and , yes , you 've guessed it , wants legal aid , too . '' The newspaper published a cartoon of a large Iraqi at dinner with his wife , reading a phrasebook , a solicitor hanging upside down from a rafter in the background . `` I 've just worked out what he said after ` I 'm English ' , '' she says . `` It was : ` Do you want to sue anybody ? ' '' Shiner received a number of death threats as a result of his work on this case . `` You 're doing it for Muslims , and Arabs , and other dirty Iraqi bastards , '' said one . He was sent packets of white powder . That was not all . The Legal Services Commission launched an investigation over allegations that he touted for business . The pressure was so great , Shiner says , that he almost felt that he could not go ahead with his marriage to Rachel , his second wife . `` For three hours , I thought , ' I ca n't do this . This is too much .

The violent images of men on horseback storming Cairo 's Tahrir Square armed with whips - among the most emblematic scenes from the 18-day revolt - not only galvanized the anti-government movement , leading to former president Hosni Mubarak 's ouster after 18 days of protests , but also scared away visitors who normally tour the Great Pyramids on horses and camels , tourist industry worker Ayman al Myonir said .

Photograph : Jim Watson\\/AFP\\/Getty CVs always get a bit of a polish when you apply for a new job . That brief disastrous part-time role becomes valuable experience , points fall off the driving licence , and even the odd GCSE grade can get promoted . But the rest of us are n't even touching America 's disaster chief when it comes to chutzpah , writes David Fickling . The Federal Emergency Management Agency -LRB- Fema -RRB- director , Michael Brown , who was today taken off the job of overseeing the Hurricane Katrina relief effort amid criticism of his agency 's laggardly response to the disaster , spent most of his working life as a lawyer . So when it came to writing his official biography someone must have thought it would be a good idea to bung in something a bit more related to emergency management . Continue reading ... The government wants to overhaul the university admissions system , changing it from a complicated muddle of deadlines and form-filling to a new complicated muddle of deadlines and form-filling . It 's always going to be that complicated because it involves assessing the skills of around 1 million students and then trying to shoehorn them into the right courses . Continue reading ... Oliver King is our new politics editor . He writes : While it 's easy to dismiss the current Conservative leadership contest as little more than a political beauty contest , the race is about far more than a job title . The future of party policy is up for grabs and senior Tories are seizing on the opportunity to dump on policies they never liked in the first place . According to this morning 's Daily Telegraph , Andrew Lansley , the party 's cerebral shadow health secretary , wants to drop their `` patients ' passport '' policy , their idea of cutting waiting lists by letting patients use NHS money to subsidise private operations . While he never said so explicitly in a speech on Wednesday to the NHS confederation , there is little doubt about what he meant . He told his audience : `` It is most important to engage the public positively with choice and competition extended to everyone , than to be directed into a benefit for a minority . '' The point being that giving patients half the cost of a # 5,000 hip operation only helps if you can afford to fund the other half . Continue reading ... The non-evacuation of New Orleans is one of the harder to understand events of the last few months . First , that while an evacuation order was given the only choice for those who could not leave , who were too frail or did not have cars , was to stay in their homes or a shelter . Second , that when evacuation buses were laid on there are several thousands who would not go . Presumably they do not want to leave the city and their possessions behind , or , amid the nightmarish toxic waters and rotting flesh , do not believe it can get any worse . For the second time this summer the first was in the Gaza Strip we are to see forced evacuations . Another international story , but this time intriguing rather than hard to understand , is the illness of Jacques Chirac . He left hospital today but , as Jon Henley will report in his World Dispatch there are allegations of a cover up over the state of his health . In Britain , the chancellor , Gordon Brown , has announced that five countries and Bill Gates are to support his International Finance Facility to raise money to immunise children in the developing world . At the Oval , England appear to be close to the end of their first innings , perhaps not as close as bowler Glenn McGrath would like , but it can not be long before they are in the field . If you are an undecided voter ahead of next week 's German election , there 's only one place to turn . So far more than 2 million Germans have already logged on to Wahl-O-Mat - an online guide to which party most corresponds with your views . Undecided voters have to answer a series of 30 questions . Some of them are overtly political : do you think , for example , that Germany 's strict dismissal protection laws should be relaxed ? Others are more general : should there be a speed limit on Germany 's autobahn , and should compulsory military service be abolished ? There is also foreign policy : do you agree that Turkey should be in the EU ? And drugs : should hashish should be legalised ? You can agree , disagree , say you are `` neutral '' or , if you are an inveterate fence-sitter - skip to the next question . At the end you click on `` result '' . Wahl-O-Mat lists the five parties in order , with the one most compatible with your views at the top . Founded in the Netherlands , Wahl-o-Mat was first used in Germany during the last election in 2002 , when some 3.6 million wavering voters logged on . It 's run by the Bundeszentrale f r politische Bildung -LRB- Federal Agency for Political Education -RRB- , an independent body . With record numbers of Germans still undecided this time , it could yet play a crucial role in determining whether Angela Merkel can put together a centre-right coalition , or is forced into a grand alliance with Gerhard Schr der 's SPD , as now seems likely . The results , of course , can be reassuring , surprising , dismaying , or baffling and may not coincide wih your own apparent preferences . When I tried it earlier this week , the Wahl-O-Mat told me I should vote for the Linkspartei , Germany 's new anti-business Left party , followed by the pro-business Liberal FDP , an unlikely pairing . Next came the Greens , followed by the SPD , with the CDU bottom - a result that surely refutes the claim made by some of you bloggers out there that I 'm some sort of CDU stooge . Anyone interested in German politics should give it a spin . There are many things that distinguish a Green party conference - opening today in the picturesque city of Lancaster - from the run-of-the-mill get-togethers of the big three parties . It is not just the pagan worship meetings -LRB- with them being held at dawn , this correspondent has yet to make it to one -RRB- , the recycling bins -LRB- it is embarrassing to consider how many forests must perish to provide journalists with printouts of speeches - most of which go straight in the bin - at the other three -RRB- or the number of small children happily galivanting around the conference floor as the looming environmental Armageddon is discussed from the podium -LRB- the Greens seem to be particularly fertile , as well as child-friendly -RRB- . What takes a little time to sink in , at least for the seasoned political anorak such as your correspondent , is what is n't here . There simply is n't any commercial or corporate sponsorship of the event . Continue reading ... A deeply shocking account by two paramedics stranded in New Orleans alleges that police lied to residents , saying buses were waiting to evacuate them - and then fired shots above their heads when they tried to reach them . It 's well worth reading in full , and gives the lie to claims that officials did all they could to help people escape the stricken city . Larrie Bradshaw and Lorrie Beth Slonsky were attending a conference in the city when the hurricane struck . Unable to find transport , they pooled money with around 500 people staying in the same hotel and paid $ 25,000 for buses to come and pick them up . `` We later learned that the minute they arrived at the city limits , they were commandeered by the military , '' the account says .

The trip left the reporter fighting for his life and his colleague dead . Now , for the first time , Frank Gardner tells his extraordinary tale of survival . By James Meek In spite of all he has endured , Frank Gardner retains his BBC voice - clear , measured , concise , registering on my old tape recorder perfectly through the din of helicopters and passenger jets passing over the cafe where we meet . His wheelchair is pulled up to the table . He has put back a little of the weight he lost in hospital . It 's a glorious early spring day , in a pleasant spot , 10 months after he was shot , but on his face , almost all the time , apart from the occasional smile , is an expression of frowning concentration , such as you see on the face of TV reporters who are first on the scene of a terrible disaster . It is quite unaffected : Gardner is still reporting from inside himself , from the war which entered him last summer , scene of his grief at the death of his colleague Simon Cumbers , his anger towards the killers , and the physical destruction of his body , which goes on causing him pain - pain that ca n't be eased without punishing side effects . `` I just think it 's cowardice to shoot somebody who 's defenceless . That is n't brave , that 's not making a stand for your beliefs , that 's just cowardice . What kind of a battle is that ? It 's one thing for them to be taking on the police in a shootout , but taking on a couple of unarmed , defenceless journalists ? '' There were times when Gardner and Cumbers would feel nervous about where they were going , but June 6 2004 , in Riyadh , Saudi Arabia , was n't one of them . The district of the Saudi capital they were visiting had , it is true , been the scene of a shootout between security forces and Islamist fundamentalist militants six months earlier - that was why the two BBC men were going , to film some general footage of the area - but they did n't feel they were taking a risk . This was n't Fallujah , or some Taliban stronghold in southern Afghanistan . This was neat , rich , outwardly modern , usually safe Riyadh . Gardner , the BBC 's security correspondent , a fluent Arab speaker at home in the Gulf , and Cumbers , an experienced cameraman , had waited for permission from the Saudi ministry of information before going . They even had a government minder with them , and a government driver in a government van . It was their last job , on the last day of their assignment to Saudi . Their flights to London were booked for the next day . In war zones , journalists on their final day tend to get jumpy but this was n't a war zone . The only anxiety left was over the story - had they got good material ? - blending with warm anticipation of going home . Gardner and Cumbers reached the area in the late afternoon . `` It looked a completely normal Gulf residential suburb ... peachy colored villas , bougainvillea coming down the walls , very average , a couple of kids playing in the street , nobody suspicious lurking in doorways and whispering or anything like that , '' says Gardner . They filmed for half an hour , and prepared to leave . Cumbers was taking his camera off its tripod . They might as well have been on the plane home already . Gardner registered a car parking a short distance away , but it did n't come to a halt with a screech of tires and brakes . The banal sound of car doors , the two nondescript young men strolling towards them in ordinary white Saudi tunics : at first Gardner assumed they were friends of the driver . Too late , as the men advanced , Gardner understood . One of them - a beardless , completely average young man , in Gardner 's description - took out a pistol . `` I shouted , in Arabic , stupidly : ` No , do n't do this ! ' as soon as I saw him pulling out the pistol , '' says Gardner . `` He was probably 30 metres from me and I took off at once - and I presume Simon ran at the same time . We ran in different directions . We had no time to make a plan . '' Gardner ran from the gunman , deeper into the district . He heard a shot and something stung his shoulder . A bullet had passed through him . There were more shots . He was hit in the leg , his leg bone was fractured , and he fell , on a patch of waste ground . `` The adrenalin was really pumping so initially the shooting did n't hurt . It felt like a massive thump . With each bullet that went in it was like being picked up by a giant hand and slammed on the ground . '' Still , these were not deadly wounds . He would have made a full recovery . But the militants were n't finished . A second vehicle drew up alongside him , a cargo van . Gardner found himself looking up into the side doorway of the van where three militants crouched , looking at him . One of them was pointing a pistol . `` I pleaded with them in Arabic not to shoot me , '' says Gardner . `` They had a very quick discussion among themselves . I could n't pick up what they were saying . Then they emptied the pistol into me at pretty much point-blank range . '' Four 9mm bullets smashed into Gardner 's spinal nerves , pelvis and abdomen . Gardner remembers the expression on the face of the man who shot him . `` It was a sneer . It was a sneer of contempt , of hatred . Maybe he saw in me President Bush , Tony Blair , Ariel Sharon , Donald Rumsfeld , all rolled into one . I do n't know . He did n't see me as a non-partisan reporter who 's simply just trying to report what 's going on . He saw me as the enemy . '' Gardner found himself lying on his front , amazed to be still alive and conscious . He closed his eyes and pretended to be dead . He heard the feet of one of the militants walking around him and prepared to die . `` I thought this is it , this is going to be the execution shot in the back of the head . '' He felt the gunman rooting in his back trouser pockets . In one , he found Cumbers ' radio mike . In the other he found a miniature Qur ` an of the kind Gardner often gave out as gifts . That discovery , Gardner believes , may have saved his life , by giving the killer pause for thought . The militants drove off , leaving him bleeding in the dust . Gardner rolled over and cried for help . His legs were paralysed . `` My cries were just a sort of animal pain ... it was almost beyond pain . I 'm amazed I did n't black out . Maybe some of the stomach acid had leaked , I do n't know . '' The locals who gathered at the scene astonished Gardner by their behavior . It was as if , by being shot , he had put himself in a world beyond them . `` They did n't help at all . To me this was extraordinary , they offered no reassurance , no glass of water , no blanket , no cushion , nothing . They were discussing the cartridge cases around . They were saying , ` Look , I think he 's been shot , has he been shot , yes , he has , look at the bullet cases there , ' as if I was just an exhibit in a museum . It was bizarre because I 've had so much hospitality in the Middle East , so much kindness . '' Instead of an ambulance , two police cars arrived .

Behind McCain 's Decision to Suspend His Campaign John McCain 's decision to suspend his campaign comes as two new polls show him slipping in the head to head matchup against Barack Obama . -LRB- AP Photo\\/Gerald Herbert -RRB- Sen. John McCain 's surprise announcement that he would temporarily suspend his campaign to return to Washington to help broker a deal to save the financial industry is the latest in a series of political gambits surrounding the financial crisis on Wall Street , and is sure to reshape political calculations and voter attitudes around the volatile issue . The move is an obvious attempt by McCain and his campaign to paint the Arizona senator as above politics , willing to put aside his campaign for the good of the country . It comes as two new national polls -- including one conducted by the Washington Post -- show McCain slipping in the head-to-head matchup against Barack Obama due in large part to voters ' inclination to trust the Illinois senator to solve the financial problems of the country . The McCain campaign believes that their candidate is at his best when he is seen as a deal-maker , willing to reach across party lines to get things done for the good of the country . This economic crisis , they believe , provides McCain a chance to show the sort of leadership that voters value in the Arizona senator . `` John McCain 's leadership and experience credentials outrank Barack Obama 's , '' said Sarah Simmons , a McCain campaign strategist , this morning . '' -LRB- We are -RRB- walking through a crisis and people are looking to see how it is going to be handled . '' Obama , however , refused to allow McCain to dictate the terms of the campaign 's next few days during a press conference in Florida just before 5 p.m. ET . `` There are times for politics and then there are times to rise above politics and do what 's right for our country , '' said Obama . `` This is one of those times . '' He added , however , that he had no plans to re-schedule Friday night 's presidential debate in Oxford , Miss. , as McCain had proposed in announcing the suspension of his campaign . `` It 's my belief that this is exactly the time when the American people need to hear from the person who in approximately 40 days will be responsible for dealing with this mess , '' said Obama . `` Part of the president 's job is to deal with more than one thing at once . '' It was not immediately clear what the fate of the debate will be if only Obama decides to show up on Friday night . Both McCain and Obama have struggled to deal with the real-time challenges of the economic crisis since it emerged on the national political landscape last weekend . Neither man is particularly well versed in the intricate complexities of the economy and have been cautious to announce their support -LRB- or opposition -RRB- to the proposed $ 700 billion bailout of the financial firms being pushed by the Bush Administration . McCain appeared to be getting the worst of the exchanges on the economy -- if recent polling is to be believed . In a new Washington Post\\/ABC News survey released today , Obama led McCain 52 percent to 43 percent , an edge largely built on the increase in the number of voters who believe the Illinois senator is best positioned to handle the economic crisis . A survey also released today from Fox News\\/Opinion Dynamics showed Obama with a 45 percent to 39 percent lead -- a significant improvement from a poll done by the same organization earlier this month that put McCain ahead by three points . The move was announced in a statement in New York City this afternoon in which the Arizona senator said he was pulling his campaign ads down and canceling all fundraising beginning tomorrow . Obama did not respond in kind . The announcement came just hours before President George W. Bush is preparing to address the nation at 9 p.m. ET tonight on the economic crisis . `` Tomorrow morning , I will suspend my campaign and return to Washington after speaking at the Clinton Global Initiative , '' McCain said . `` I have spoken to Senator Obama and informed him of my decision and have asked him to join me . '' McCain went on to compare the current crisis in the financial markets with the attacks of Sept. 11 and called on politicians to draw on the bipartisan spirit created during those times in order to solve the economic problems of the country today . `` Following September 11th , our national leaders came together at a time of crisis , '' McCain said . `` We must show that kind of patriotism now . Americans across our country lament the fact that partisan divisions in Washington have prevented us from addressing our national challenges . Now is our chance to come together to prove that Washington is once again capable of leading this country . '' The next 48 hours will be the equivalent of a political staring contest . Who will blink first ? And , if neither candidate does , what will happen Friday night ? A presidential debate with only one presidential candidate ? By Chris Cillizza | September 24 , 2008 ; 5:15 PM ET `` McCain is wrong for not showing up to debate . This maybe the only time he will be able to show that he is better than Obama . '' OOOH Please , Obama is n't qualified for this people plain and simple he would have voted for this to pass without thinking twice . He 's a mouthpiece that 's about it . I commend McCain for getting in the middle of it and slowing the damn thing down so it can be scrutinized . The coveted debate that everyone seems to think needs to happen right THIS MINUTE could potentially cost the taxpayers 700 Billion dollars . They do n't need a blank check I would much rather see the government buy up the bad housing loans . That will stop the bleeding . Banks tighten up loan criteria and ride it out . This maybe the only time he will be able to show that he is better than Obama . No , I 'm not talking about tomorrow 's debate with Barack Obama : `` With new polls showing his campaign dead in the water among California Republicans , Arizona Sen. John McCain has pulled out of a long-scheduled debate with Texas Gov. George Bush , set for Thursday in Los Angeles . '' `` McCain campaign officials tried desperately yesterday to put the best face on their withdrawal , even as a new Field Poll showed Bush far ahead among likely Republican voters in the winner-take-all race for the state 's 162 GOP delegates . '' `` The bait and switch on the debate left the Arizona senator -- whose favorite campaign line is `` I 'll always tell you the truth '' -- wide open to blistering criticism from his rivals . '' `` Clearly , this is more double-talk from the McCain campaign , '' said Alixe Mattingly , a spokeswoman for Bush . `` Pulling out of this debate at the last minute is an indication that they 're pulling out of California , where McCain 's antagonistic message clearly is n't working . '' And clearly , McCain has a habit of trying to `` cut and run '' when things are n't going his way . Send Sarah Palin in his stead . That 's what Vice-Presidents are for , right ? Before you blame the Republicans , guess who wanted to regulate ... and guess who did not want to -- Watch the vid in my blog ! You will be shocked . We the taxpayers pay them a pretty hefty salary . They are not just running for office . At a time when congress is working on such a crucial package , I would rather see my senator in Washington doing his job than spending his time , paid for by my taxpayer money , out campaigning . `` On Sunday , in an interview with CNBC and The", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "John McCain has decided to suspend his presidential campaign to return to Washington and help broker a deal to save the financial industry.", "prop_score_1": 0.5, "generate_explanation_1": "In a surprising move, John McCain has put aside his campaign to address the current economic crisis.

I am amazed at the Egyptian people who are protesting in the face of the a giant government . They are a brave courageous people who have made it clear what they do n't want : Mubarak ! There are no voices rising up for what they do want . What is an acceptable temporary replacement so as to avoid anarchy after Mubarak is ousted ? I fear they could be over run by something\\/someone they have n't chosen .

I really wish someone of those people surrounding Mubarak , takes it upon himself , and walks up to Mubarak and whispers in his ears that he needs to leave . Actually Mubarak is 82 years old man , who is out of touch , and clinking on his day job . last time I checked , Hmmm , let me see ... Egypt is not a monarchy . He needs to leave - !!!! Once all the dust has settled and Mubarek is gone , the question being asked especially in the U.S. , is what next ? Who 's the leader ? The fact that there are no viable opposition parties seems to make westerners nervous , because their system of politics is all that they understand . What 's important is to trust these good people to prevent chaos , and to ensure that they are governed . A coalition of several prominent individuals could work as an interim government until an election is held . After all that they 've been through I have no doubt that Egyptians will get it done , and that they will be able to cooperate with one another . Perhaps the partisan , bitter party infighting which characterizes American politics is NOT the way for Egyptians to go . They have the floor , so let 's just watch rather than fretting that `` there 's no leader '' .

January 31 , 2011 at 11:41 pm | Anderson Cooper , Please expose to the world that the looting going on in Egypt is not from the protesters . They are plain clothes policemen and criminals that were let loose from the jails in Cairo . The regime is doing this to spread fear amongst Egyptians and to keep the protesters off the streets . Also , please expose the Egyptian chivalry and bravery . The ones protecting the streets now are the Egyptian people themselves . They are doing this in shifts and organizing themselves in the absence of law . With chaos on the streets caused by criminals and escape prisoners , there is no way to filter out the bad from the good without the army being given some power to take control . In order to effectively provide protection for the citizens of Egypt , the residents must return to their homes and clear the streets allowing a representative to speak on their behalf . The country is at greater risk of danger if the military are overtaken by evil doers pretending to be their friends . They must be strong now ... punish those who are committing crimes and protect the innocent . Use force if necessary to accomplish this .

It is actually a fake threat , The people do not want The Muslim Brotherhood and will never choose them .

Yet beneath the surface there has echoed a national conversation of passion and seriousness . Thoughtful people have debated for months with families , friends and colleagues - and with themselves - about how to vote in this contest . Much of the electorate is still undecided . It is an imperfect choice conducted under the imperfect electoral system which is nevertheless the only one that we have got . What to do on Thursday ? Let 's be honest : it is difficult . This newspaper 's answer to this unshirkable question involves taking the long and broad view . While 2005 will be remembered as Tony Blair 's Iraq election , May 5 is not a referendum on that one decision , however fateful , or on the person who led it , however controversial . Like all others , this election must in the end come down to a verdict between the candidates and parties that will produce a parliament and a government . Yet Iraq overhangs this election for many . It is the issue that makes them most squeamish about voting Labor . The decision to bend this country 's foreign and defense policy quite so pliantly to US imperatives has taken a terrible toll on public confidence in the way this country is run . It has been a dreadful distraction from other priorities , of which climate change is the most important . It is the root cause of an equally destructive toll on Mr Blair 's public standing and of a wounded anger that has haunted this campaign all the way to May 5 . But does this mean that we recommend a vote against Labor ? Nearly a century ago , the great editor of this newspaper , CP Scott , reflected in this column on an approaching election in terms that are as relevant today as they were then . As a result of three-cornered contests , Scott wrote : `` It is quite possible that while Liberalism and Labor are snapping and snarling at each other the Conservative dog may run away with the bone . That would be lamentable . '' If such an outcome would have been lamentable in the early 20th century , it would be just as lamentable in the early 21st . It is a moral disgrace . Immediately this is because of the damaging and divisive campaign on immigration that Michael Howard has run this time . For this reason alone , it is vital to stop the Conservatives . But there is a longer term reason too . Eight years on from 1997 , the Tory party has not rethought what it wants to offer the British people in the 21st century . Until it does , it does not deserve to be elected . CP Scott speaks across the century on other matters too . Scott spent much of his life arguing for what he described as the `` reunion '' of the `` party of progress '' . Today , that division remains a reality . Eight years ago , on the eve of the 1997 election , we described ourselves as recognizing `` without embarrassment or apology that we , the Liberal Democrats and the Labor party are companions on the journey down the same broad river of progressive politics '' . In 2005 , though we have all been tumbled about by some rapids , that remains true . The modern progressive consensus of which Gordon Brown speaks will be the work not of one party alone , but of two . In that general sense , therefore , we would not be true to this newspaper 's deep traditions if we saw anything wrong in principle with a switch of allegiance between the two progressive parties in 2005 . People must vote their conscience , and there are powerful reasons for casting one 's vote for the Liberal Democrats this time . This is especially the case because the Liberal Democrats opposed the Iraq war , as this newspaper also did . But it is also because the Liberal Democrats have been vigilant and rational in their defense of individual liberty since September 11 2001 . The party at least grasps , as many in Labor do not , that fairness , liberty and the law are not merely pieces on a political chessboard , to be sacrificed in some cold-blooded trade-off with the need for security , but are also part of the soul and identity of this nation . It may be , indeed , that the time is approaching when the Liberal Democrats will be electorally powerful enough , politically coherent enough and well enough led to be considered as a true party of government . That depends partly on Labor and partly on the Liberal Democrats themselves . If and when it happens , we look forward to it . But that time is not yet and not now . There is too much that is unconvincing about Liberal Democrat thinking on too many important subjects . The party needs to stare more unflinchingly at the possibility and reality of power than it has yet done . That is not something one can now say about Labor . Labor has become comfortable in power . There are alarming , unattractive and plain unacceptable aspects of this , many of them embodied in the way Mr Blair took us to war . If there was one general overarching change we would demand from Labor in the parliament to come it is that it should better respect the visible and invisible lines of the separation of powers in British government : the centrality of parliament , the importance of cabinet , the independence of the judges , the indispensable role of independent scrutiny and audit . Ours is not a presidential system . Yet Labor 's comfort with power has strengths too , and no one feels them more than the millions who have little voice in the running of any aspect of modern Britain . Labor this week stands on the threshold of something it has never achieved : a third successive working majority in parliament . It stands there because , over the past 11 years Mr Blair and Mr Brown have systematically forced the party to rethink itself . As a result Labor has left behind the era of unheroic failure and has made itself the master of the era of steady , incremental success . Millions of people owe essential parts of their present prosperity and greater opportunities to Labor 's methodical investment in the public services and the common realm . It is too easy sometimes to overlook the real substance of what Labor has achieved in these years . In the first place , it has built a stable economic platform - low inflation , sustained growth , low unemployment - which makes everything else possible and which would be at great risk under any other government . Second , it is on the way to winning the argument about the need for public service investment that is the cornerstone of all possibility of real social justice . Having started the work in rebuilding the health service , investing in schools and modestly redistributing , Labor has a powerful case for now going further , exemplified by the plans for early years support for young families . It is the most redistributive of all the main parties and it deserves support on that count alone . There is much to regret about the eight years of Labor government - the missed opportunities , among which Europe stands out , the enduring fear of offending corporate vested interests , the underestimate of what could have been achieved amidst the national and international goodwill of the early years , the sometimes disabling effect of the frequently formidable Blair-Brown relationship . Above all there has been the visible transformation of the prime minister himself from a figure of almost limitless modern social-democratic possibilities and gifts to a widely disrespected leader whose political shelf-life is now clearly - and rightly - limited .

AP NEW ORLEANS -- Glaring errors and omissions in BP 's oil spill response plans have exposed a slapdash effort to follow environmental rules , outraging Gulf Coast residents who can see on their beaches how unprepared the company was . BP PLC 's 582-page regional spill plan for the Gulf , and its 52-page , site-specific plan for the Deepwater Horizon rig vastly understate the dangers posed by an uncontrolled leak and vastly overstate the company 's preparedness to deal with one , according to an Associated Press analysis . The lengthy plans were approved by the federal government last year before BP drilled its ill-fated well . Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal was incensed Wednesday after reading the AP story and said BP has been reactive -- not proactive -- all along . `` Look , it 's obvious to everybody in south Louisiana that they did n't have a plan , they did n't have an adequate plan to deal with this spill , '' Jindal said . `` They did n't anticipate the BOP -LRB- blowout preventer -RRB- failure . They did n't anticipate this much oil hitting our coast . From the very first days , they kept telling us , ` Do n't worry , the oil 's not going to make it to your coast . ' '' Among the glaring errors in the report : A professor is listed in BP 's 2009 response plan for a Gulf of Mexico oil spill as a national wildlife expert . He died in 2005 . The plan lists cold-water marine mammals including walruses , sea otters , sea lions and seals as `` sensitive biological resources . '' None of those animals live anywhere near the Gulf . Also , names and phone numbers of several Texas A&M University marine life specialists are wrong . So are the numbers for marine mammal stranding network offices in Louisiana and Florida , which are disconnected . `` The AP report paints a picture of a company that was making it up as it went along , while telling regulators it had the full capability to deal with a major spill , '' Sen. Bill Nelson , D-Fla . , wrote in an e-mail to the AP . `` We know that was n't true . '' Nelson said he and Sen. Barbara Boxer , D-Calif . , have asked for a criminal investigation into some of the company 's claims . Earlier this month , the federal government announced criminal and civil investigations into the Gulf of Mexico oil spill . Attorney General Eric Holder has not said who might be targeted in the probes into the largest oil spill in U.S. history . Legal experts say that to file criminal charges , the Justice Department will have to find evidence that BP or other companies involved in the deadly oil rig explosion and subsequent spill orchestrated a coverup , destroyed key documents or lied to government agents . Charges and civil penalties can be brought under a variety of environmental protection laws . In its Deepwater Horizon plan , the British oil giant stated : `` BP Exploration and Production Inc. has the capability to respond , to the maximum extent practicable , to a worst case discharge , or a substantial threat of such a discharge , resulting from the activities proposed in our Exploration Plan . '' In the spill scenarios detailed in the documents , fish , marine mammals and birds escape serious harm ; beaches remain pristine ; water quality is only a temporary problem . And those are the projections for a leak about 10 times worse than what has been calculated for the ongoing disaster . Rep. Darrell Issa of California , the top Republican on the House Oversight and Government Reform committee , is investigating failures by the federal Minerals Management Service , which regulates oil rigs . He said Wednesday that if there had been a serious effort to reform the agency , the `` mistakes '' in BP 's report would have been caught . `` This is yet another example of MMS acting as a rubber stamp for industry , and industry settling for the lowest possible standard of safety at the expense the environment and economic vitality of the Gulf region , '' he said . BP spokesman Daren Beaudo said the response plans will be reviewed `` so that we can determine what worked well and what needs improvement . '' `` Thus far we have implemented the largest spill response in history and many , many elements of it have worked well . However , we are greatly disappointed that oil has made landfall and impacted shorelines and marshes . The situation we are dealing with is clearly complex , unprecedented and will offer us much to learn from , '' Beaudo said . The plans contain wildly false assumptions about oil spills . BP 's proposed method to calculate spill volume judging by the darkness of the oil sheen is way off . The internationally accepted formula would produce estimates 100 times higher . The Gulf 's loop current , which is projected to help eventually send oil hundreds of miles around Florida 's southern tip and up the Atlantic coast , is n't mentioned in either plan . The website listed for Marine Spill Response Corp. -- one of two firms that BP relies on for equipment to clean a spill -- links to a defunct Japanese-language page . In early May , at least 80 Louisiana state prisoners were trained to clean birds by listening to a presentation and watching a video . It was a work force never envisioned in the plans , which contain no detailed references to how birds would be cleansed of oil . And while BP officials and the federal government have insisted that they have attacked the problem as if it were a much larger spill , that is n't apparent from the constantly evolving nature of the response . Asked if he was angry about the inadequate plans , Jindal said : `` Absolutely . You ca n't just assume the best . Your plan ca n't be , well , the BOP is going to work . Your plan ca n't be , well , the oil is not going to travel more than 50 miles and reach our coast . Your plan ca n't be that if the BOP does n't work , then the junk shot is going to work , then the mud kill shot is going to work . '' This week , after BP reported the seemingly good news that a containment cap installed on the wellhead was funneling some of the gushing crude to a tanker on the surface , BP introduced a whole new set of plans mostly aimed at capturing more oil . The latest incarnation calls for building a larger cap , using a special incinerator to burn off some of the recaptured oil and bringing in a floating platform to process the oil being sucked away from the gushing well . In other words , the on-the-fly planning continues . One of the most glaring errors in BP 's plans involves Dr. Peter Lutz , a Florida professor , one of several dozen experts recommended as resources to be contacted in the event of a spill . Lutz is listed as a go-to wildlife specialist at the University of Miami . But Lutz , an eminent sea turtle expert , left Miami almost 20 years ago to chair the marine biology department at Florida Atlantic University in Boca Raton . He died four years before the plan was published . Molly Lutcavage , a research professor at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst who worked closely with Lutz on a groundbreaking report on the effects of oil on sea turtles , was dismayed to hear that Lutz was still listed in the response plan . `` It 's horribly depressing and shocking that so little attention is paid to a bona fide contingency plan , '' she said . `` What would Peter think ? I think he would think it was typical of bureaucracy . '' There are other examples of how BP 's plans have fallen short : -- Beaches where oil washed up within weeks of a spill were supposed to be safe from contamination because BP promised it could marshal more than enough boats to scoop up all the oil before any deepwater spill could reach shore -- a claim that in retrospect seems absurd . `` The vessels in question maintain the necessary spill containment and recovery equipment to respond effectively , '' one of the documents says .

WOLF BLITZER , CNN ANCHOR : Egypt 's president Hosni Mubarak is certainly feeling the heat right now as new vice president Omar Suleiman said on state television today that Mubarak has asked him to start working immediately on `` real political reform . '' Right after that , the vice president 's office said that talks with opposition parties are already under way . Right now , it 's 1:00 a.m. in Egypt . A Monday scene in Cairo 's Liberation Square may be the calm though before the storm . In just a few hours , massive demonstrations billed as a `` Million-Man '' march are planned across the country . And now we 're learning the Egyptian government is shutting down , get this , shutting down all mobile phone networks in the country ahead of the march . Already , essential supplies are running very , very low . There have been long lines in front of bread shops , food markets , gas stations and banks are closed . ATM machines are in the dark . A lack of security and lack of cash paralyzing the Egyptian capital right now . And the military , the Egyptian military is n't just guarding the streets and strategic locations . Modern weapons are now protecting the very symbols of ancient Egypt . CNN 's Ivan Watson is joining us now live now from Cairo with more . IVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Well , Wolf , on this seventh day of protests , the crowd in Cairo 's central Tahrir Square of demonstrators was bigger than Saturday 's crowd , was bigger than Sunday 's crowd , bigger than ever , in fact . Meanwhile , out in the streets of the Egyptian capital , we saw troops , tanks , armored personnel carriers fanning out , a dramatic increase in the amount of troops in the Egyptian in the streets of the city . Take a look at this report . WATSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : One of the world 's most famous landmarks now guarded by army tanks . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : Soldiers have been deployed all around this city , and the tanks are even parked here at one of the ancient wonders of the world , the Great Pyramids of Giza . -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : An army officer insisted the Pyramids are still open for tourists , but the soldiers would n't let us come any closer . On Monday , the troop presence was dramatically increased in Cairo , soldiers trained to defend their country from foreign enemies now taking on the duties of largely absent police -- an effort to restore law and order in a frightened city bearing the scars of several days and nights of unrest . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : This is part of what has Egyptians so scared right now , a number of hotels and cabarets and casinos like this that were torched and looted in the first days of the protests . -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : Most of the businesses in town are still closed . With the normal working day cut in half by a curfew that started at 3:00 p.m. , Egyptians had a few short hours to shop for groceries -- among those foraging for food in largely empty streets , this family from Taiwan stranded while on vacation , hoping to catch a flight out of the country on Tuesday . After a week of sweeping historic changes , some Egyptians taking it upon themselves to clean up the debris left by days of protests . -LRB- on camera -RRB- : There is a civic-minded dimension to this protest movement here . We have come to the street , and ordinary people , they 're not being paid to do this . These are volunteers , students , demonstrators who are out cleaning up the streets . Is somebody paying you to clean these streets ? ISRA NASRI , EGYPTIAN PHARMACY STUDENT : No , no , no. . No somebody pay me . No , I 'm just -- I 'm volunteer . I 'm coming -- no , no , no pay , no -- no money , no. . WATSON : And why -- why -- why are you volunteering ? NASRI : Because this my country . I wanted to clean it . WATSON : What is going to happen to your country ? NASRI : I do n't know , but I want it to better . That 's all I want , to be better and to be -- to have a good president . WATSON -LRB- voice-over -RRB- : After years of fear , these Egyptians are no longer afraid to repeat this simple demand : They want a better government . WATSON : Now , Wolf , thousands of people were in Cairo 's central Tahrir Square this evening . And their demonstration had shifted more to a sit-in . They set up tents . They lit campfires underneath the palm trees . And as you mentioned , the vice president giving a televised address during which he called for dialogue with opposition parties and he said , yes , I agree there are problems , questions that have to be addressed that have been raised by the youth . This has been very much a youth-driven movement so far of street protests . But we are also hearing from an official inside the Information Ministry telling us that the phone , the cellular phone networks are likely to be cut off in the coming hours . The train links have been cut off as well . It does seem like efforts by the government to try to stop or at least reduce the number of people invited to participate in what opposition groups have dubbed tomorrow 's million man march -- Wolf . BLITZER : I just saw your tweet on that , Ivan , that the phone systems , the cellular phone systems , the mobile phone systems in Egypt are about to be shut down to try to stop people from getting involved in that march . But that -- that potentially could have the opposite effect from the Egyptian government 's perspective . It could really embolden those young people especially to go out there , given how sophisticated the Egyptian mobile phone system is right now . WATSON : Well , what we saw was the cellular phone networks were shut down on Friday , and you had running street battles taking place between demonstrators and the police , which have now largely evaporated from the streets . We do n't see them out in uniform anymore , except for a few traffic cops I saw today . And , instead now , the big rallying point has become this central square , Tahrir , or Liberation , Square . And that 's a place where people are gathering . And they 're not communicating via Facebook or Twitter or e-mail . Instead they 're simply handing out flyers , photocopies and that is where you will see posters that have been put up inviting people to participate starting at 10:00 a.m. local time in what has been dubbed a million man match . We will just have to see what 's going to happen later on Tuesday . BLITZER : Ivan , we will stay in touch with you and all of our reporters in Cairo and Alexandria , elsewhere in Egypt . We also have some extraordinary images just coming in showing just how tense the situation on the streets of Cairo is right now . This amateur video that we 're about to show you shows a confrontation between security forces and a gathering crowd . Shots are fired and the threat seems to subside as the crowd starts chanting the people and the army are one . The U.S. has launched around-the-clock efforts to airlift , to evacuate Americans out of Egypt . The State Department now saying it 's evacuated more than 1,000 people today , hopes to evacuate another 1,000 tomorrow . Here 's the State Department 's spokesman , P.J. Crowley . P.J.

Don Lemon here at the CNN world headquarters in Atlanta . Thank you so much for joining us . A popular uprising in Egypt that threatens to bring down the presidency of Hosni Mubarak now in its fifth day . LEMON : Dozens of people have died in violent clashes with riot police over the past week . Many others have been injured . Here you see the body of one victim carried today through the streets of Cairo . It is impossible to know how many people were out protesting today . But tens of thousands , it 's safe to say is an estimate . One major change is the disappearance of riot police . Now , military troops and vehicles fill parts of Cairo . And for the most part , the military and civilians have avoided clashing with each other . But what we are now seeing is how protests have spread to cities around the world . LEMON : Impassioned Egyptian-Americans gathered in Washington today , calling for the removal of Egypt 's president . They rallied first at the Egyptian embassy and then marched to the White House . Inside the White House , President Obama huddled with his national security team to discuss the crisis . There 's a lot at stake because Egypt has one of America 's biggest Arab allies in the Middle East . LEMON : And we are getting similar protest videos and iReports from across the U.S. and around the world . This rally took place in downtown Montreal -- Atlanta , Chicago , New York , Los Angeles and many other places had similar demonstrations to show their support for the uprising in Egypt . We 'll hear from them throughout this hour . Social order and security have collapsed across Egypt 's largest cities . As darkness falls , looting has become pervasive . And without police , many shopkeepers are arming themselves to protect their stores from looters . There have also been conflicting reports about looting of priceless artifacts from the national museum . And right now , it appears the museum is secure . We 'll let you know if we get any additional information about that . A lot of people are concerned about . We 're also just now getting word from Nile TV that about 1,000 inmates have escaped from a large prison outside Cairo . CNN 's Ivan Watson has a live report from Cairo in just a moment on that . He 's going to update us on that situation . So , Michael , let me start with you . Michael is a Christian broadcaster here . He is Michael Youssef . And you and your family came from Egypt 1997 . What do you make tonight as you see this drama unfold and you hear about the riot police and all of that ? MICHAEL YOUSSEF , CHRISTIAN BROADCASTER : I actually escaped from Egypt back in the '60s when I left . I came to the States in ' 77 . But -- so , I know what dictatorship is lived under Nasser . And it 's really very disconcerting as I talk to several leaders in Egypt , Christian leaders and others , of the looting shops , banks . And so many young people are arming themselves because they ca n't have guns with sticks in order to defend their families and their possessions . It 's really , very , very , very disconcerting . I was talking to an 80-year-old person who said , I 've never seen anything like it . LEMON : So , listen , you know , you said you escaped . Is it necessarily -- and , you know , maybe people in America for the most part will read this a certain way -- that Hosni Mubarak , if he is removed from power , is there some good to what Hosni Mubarak has done for Egypt ? YOUSSEF : Well , I personally think so . And everybody has a different perspective , you know ? Number one , he was a war hero . He is the one that led the Air Force at the Yom Kippur War . And so , the younger generations coming up -- I 'm 62 now . So , I lived through the days of Nasser in the '60s , and saw the improvements that Mubarak made and I travel -- YOUSSEF : A lot of the economy . I mean , their economic growth is about 6.5 percent annually . And private enterprise , privatizing banks and companies and allowing more and more -- of course , not enough for young people to be able to have employment . I know that I had a driver who was a lawyer and he is making more money driving a car than practicing law . LEMON : He 's making more money . LEMON : But comparatively , it 's not a lot of money when you consider how much money most people make in Europe . LEMON : It does n't compare to the United States or most countries at all ? And inflation is humongous . It 's a problem . LEMON : Here 's what -- why would one support Hosni Mubarak , who has lots of money , lots and lots of money , if you are living and you have to wait in queue to buy basic needs and get necessities . Why would there be support for someone like that in the country ? YOUSSEF : I do n't know what kind of money he has . It 's my -- I 'm not here to defend him . But -- and I think , the people have every right to demonstrate . It 's disconcerting the fact this turning into violence . LEMON : All right . Stand by , Michael . I want to talk to you throughout the show . And a little bit later on , I want to go now to Ivan Watson who joins us now . He is in Cairo . And he 's been watching this unfold . Ivan , what are you seeing now ? And also , talk to me about the prisoners who have escaped there . IVAN WATSON , CNN CORRESPONDENT : Don , I 'm sorry . I could n't quite hear your question there . We 've had some interruptions with the audio here . Basically , it 's now after 1:00 in the morning , 2:00 in the morning here . And the center of Cairo , the Egyptian capital , is quite calm . I do n't know if you can see over my shoulder . But we 've got a number of army tanks parked here along the banks of the Nile , perhaps a reassuring sign for some residents of this sprawling city who are concerned by the disappearance of the police force after the battles that raged in these streets between the very unpopular police officers and demonstrators that resulted in basically the police evaporating overnight and not really having much of a presence at all in the city . Some fears of looting -- I 've seen stores and shops in residential areas that were looted over the course of the previous night . And that is a concern , maintaining law and order . And that is one of the arguments -- LEMON : That 's our Ivan Watson reporting to us live there in Cairo . And as you can see , we 're having a little bit of trouble with the satellite transmission . But just a short while ago , Ivan went out and he witnessed firsthand what people are doing there and spoke to some of the protesters . WATSON : The crowds have gathered here .

Madam , are you going to go inside when the curfew starts ? UNIDENTIFIED FEMALE : No , I will not go inside , over my dead body . They will kill me , no problem .

His face was gaunt and sunburned . Ticks , fleas and lice covered his body . Before battle , his lips would quiver and his body went numb . When the shooting started , some of his comrades burst into maniacal laughter . Others bit the throat and ears of their enemy . And some were shattered by shells so powerful that tufts of their hair stuck to rocks and trees . Take a tour of a Civil War battlefield today , and it 's difficult to connect the terrifying experience of an average Civil War soldier -- described above from various historical accounts -- with the tranquil historic sites where we now snap pictures today . And the opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John F. Kennedy . John F. Kennedy explained , `` the Confederate leader is American , '' and that Confederate leaders are American heroes . Look at today 's headlines . As the nation commemorates the 150th anniversary of its deadliest war this week , some historians say we 're still fighting over some of the same issues that fueled the Civil War . `` There are all of these weird parallels , '' says Stephanie McCurry , author of `` Confederate Reckoning , '' a new book that examines why Southerners seceded and its effect on Southern women and slaves . `` When you hear charges today that the federal government is overreaching , and the idea that the Constitution recognized us as a league of sovereign states -- these were all part of the secessionist charges in 1860 , '' she says . They point to four parallels : The disappearance of the political center If you think the culture wars are heated now , check out mid-19th century America . The Civil War took place during a period of pervasive piety when both North and South demonized one another with self-righteous , biblical language , one historian says . One of the biggest debates during the Civil War was how far should governments go in dictating our lives . We still debate those politics . -- William Blair , Civil War historian The war erupted not long after the `` Second Great Awakening '' sparked a national religious revival . Reform movements spread across the country . Thousands of Americans repented of their sins at frontier campfire meetings and readied themselves for the Second Coming . They got war instead . Their moral certitude helped make it happen , says David Goldfield , author of `` America Aflame , '' a new book that examines evangelical Christianity 's impact on the war . Goldfield says evangelical Christianity `` poisoned the political process '' because the American system of government depends on compromise and moderation , and evangelical religion abhors both because `` how do you compromise with sin . '' `` By transforming political issues into moral causes , you raise the stakes of the conflict and you tend to demonize your opponents , '' Goldfield says . Contemporary political rhetoric is filled with similar rhetoric . Opponents are n't just wrong -- they 're sinners , Goldfield says . `` The erosion of the center in contemporary American politics is the most striking parallel between today and the time just before the Civil War , '' Goldfield says . In the lead-up to the war , political campaigns were filled with religious fervor . Political parties paraded their piety and labeled opponents infidels . `` Today 's government gridlock results , in part , from this religious mind set that many issues can be divided into good and evil and sin and salvation , '' he says . A Union artillery crew poses before battle . Each side underestimated the opposing army , historians say . How much power should the federal government have ? Nullification , states ' rights and secession . Those terms might sound like they 're lifted from a Civil War history book , but they 're actually making a comeback on the national stage today . Since the rise of the Tea Party and debate over the new health care law , more Republican lawmakers have brandished those terms . Republican lawmakers in at least 11 states invoked nullification to thwart the new health care law , according to a recent USA Today article . It was the kind of talk that led to the Civil War , historians say . `` One of the biggest debates during the Civil War was how far should governments go in dictating our lives . We still debate those politics , '' says William Blair , director of the George and Ann Richards Civil War Era Center at Pennsylvania State University . The Southern answer to that question ignited the war . When they seceded , their leaders said that they were protecting the inherent rights of sovereign states . They invoked the 13 Colonies ' fight for independence . We wanted to be left alone . What actually caused the war was Lincoln 's insistence that , no , we ca n't let these people go . -- H.W. Crocker III , Southern historian Civilians reenacting war as a hobby Budget threatened Civil War anniversary H.W. Crocker III , author of `` The Politically Incorrect Guide to the Civil War , '' says Southern secessionists were patriots reaffirming the Founding Fathers ' belief that the Colonies were free and independent states . `` If the Southern states pulled out of the union today after , say , the election of Barack Obama , or some other big political issue like abortion , how many of us would think the appropriate reaction from the federal government would be to blockade Southern ports and send armies into Virginia ? '' He says men such as Jefferson Davis , the leader of the Confederacy , are American heroes . `` Jefferson Davis was not trying to force anything on the people in the North , '' he says . `` We wanted to be left alone . What actually caused the war is Lincoln 's insistence that no , we ca n't let these people go . '' Slavery caused the war , says McCurry , author of `` Confederate Reckoning , '' and most historians . Southern slaveholders invoked the Revolution while trying to build an antidemocratic slave state `` dedicated to the proposition that all men are not created equal , '' McCurry says . They also did n't want to lose the tremendous wealth generated by slave labor , she says . `` They felt confident because they were the biggest producers of cotton in the Western world at the height of the Industrial Revolution . '' Unleashing the dogs of war During the run-up to the Iraq War , former Vice President Dick Cheney famously declared that American troops would be welcomed as `` liberators '' in Iraq . Cheney made the mistake that political leaders have been making for ages -- he did n't know the enemy , says Emory Thomas , author of `` The Dogs of War , '' which examines how ignorance on both sides led to the Civil War . `` Cheney thought it was going to be France in 1944 , but it ended up Georgia in 1864 , '' Thomas says . Civil War leaders made the same mistake , Thomas says . Northern leaders like Lincoln did n't really think ordinary Southerners who had no slaves would fight in defense of slavery . Southerners did n't think Northerners were willing to go to war to preserve the Union , he says . And few on both sides expected the war to be so bloody and long . `` America in 1861 did n't realize what the hell they were doing , '' he says . `` They just were n't willing to think of unpleasant possibilities . '' We risk the same mistakes when we commit to `` limited '' military campaigns in places such as Iraq and , most recently , Libya , Thomas says . When President Obama announced a limited air bombing campaign in Libya , Thomas thought about the political leaders before the Civil War . Each incrementally committed to various military provocations , thinking events would n't spiral out of control . `` Once you commit to war , you do n't have any control over how it ends , '' Thomas says . `` It 's amazing how that sounds like Libya now .

As I ve watched the Libyan adventure unfold , I ve been particularly interested by the myriad justifications that proponents have offered for intervention . Since then , in the absence of intervention in Libya is to protect civilians from Gadhafi 's forces , the United States has stated that its military- goal is to disrupt the command and control of loyalist forces in an attempt to quickly resolve the civil war . Beyond this narrow mandate , however , an additional set of overlapping reasons have been put forth , before and since the intervention began on March 19 . Below are but five of the more prominent secondary justifications put forth by Obama administration officials , congressional members , pundits , and policy analysts . On the second day of the bombing campaign , cruise missiles were launched into Moammar Gadhafi 's Bab al-Azizia compound in Tripoli . The stated military objective was to disrupt the command and control of loyalist forces , but the immediate intention was to kill Gadhafi in an attempt to quickly resolve the civil war . The day prior , British defense minister Liam Fox was asked if Gadhafi was a legitimate target , and responded that attacking the Libyan leader would potentially be a possibility . Since then , while NATO officials emphasize that it does not intentionally target specific individuals , the alliance has routinely bombed Gadhafi 's suspected residences , including one attack that reportedly killed the Libyan leader s son and three of his grandchildren . Since then , the calls for regime change through a targeted killing have only increased . Five weeks into the NATO-led bombing campaign , Senator Lindsey Graham demanded that the alliance cut the head of the snake off , go to Tripoli , start bombing -LRB- Gadhafi 's -RRB- inner circle . Senator John McCain further lamented that while President Obama was limiting America s military mission to achieve primarily humanitarian objectives , the fact is that we need to take -LRB- Gadhafi -RRB- out . Foggy Bottom , apparently , wants Gadhafi deposed but only of his own volition . Last week , when presented with several potential diplomatic solutions to resolving the civil war , a State Department spokesperson responded that the only option that the United States was willing to entertain was Gadhafi stepping down from power . Thus , beyond the initial stated military mission of protecting civilians , the only acceptable outcome of the intervention has become the removal of Gadhafi from power , with the bombing campaign continuing until whenever that objective is achieved . Sending a Message to Other Dictators The Libyan uprising and subsequent civil war occurred within the broader context of the Arab Spring that began in neighboring Tunisia , and has swept across North Africa into the Middle East . It was believed by many that the demonstration effect of intervening to attempt to stop the brutal repression used by the Gadhafi regime would deter other dictators from doing likewise . As the events in Yemen , Bahrain , Syria , and even Libya have demonstrated , attempting to use force for second-order psychological effects is a fool s errand , and should not be included as a justification for military intervention in the first place . Nevertheless , in the absence of intervention in Libya s civil war , President Obama warned in his March 28 address to the nation that the democratic impulses would be eclipsed by the darkest form of dictatorship , as repressive leaders concluded that violence is the best strategy to cling to power ; former State Department official , Anne Marie Slaughter , contended that if Colonel Gadhafi wins , regimes across the region will conclude that force is the way to answer protests ; Nicholas Kristof , New York Times columnist , claimed that If not for this intervention the message would have gone out to all dictators that ruthlessness works ; former British Prime Minister Tony Blair wrote , We would send a signal of Western impotence in a region that analyzes such signals keenly ; and Senator John Kerry believed that a military intervention in Libya sends a critical signal to other leaders in the region : They can not automatically assume they can resort to large-scale violence to put down legitimate demands for reform without consequences . Supporting the Libyan Rebels While the Libyan rebels have been unable to remove Gadhafi from power , its self-appointed leadership group the Transitional National Council -LRB- TNC -RRB- has succeeded at courting western support since its founding on March 5 . Utilizing the skills of multi-national public relations firms like the Harbour Group and Bell Pottinger , the TNC has consistently portrayed itself as inclusive , western-educated , committed to democratic principles , and opposed to any Islamist influences . The TNC s official website motto : Freedom . Democracy provides upbeat messages about the progress of the war , and extensive coverage of every foreign official who tours Benghazi . After one such visit in mid-May , Senator John McCain vouched for the rebel leadership , stating : Their Prime Minister got a doctorate at the University of Pittsburgh . Their Finance Minister was recently teaching economics in Seattle others are lawyers , doctors , women activists . Similarly , after British Foreign Secretary William Hague held talks with the TNC in the rebel-held capital in early June , he declared : These people at the top of this organization are genuine believers in democracy and the rule of law . It is quite inspiring . After another early June visit to Benghazi , Assistant Secretary of State for Near Eastern Affairs Jeffrey Feltman wrote of being profoundly impressed by everyone he encountered , and drew a vivid picture for how the military intervention in Libya was transforming America s image in the Arab world : Imagine walking in the main square of a teeming Arab city and having people wave the American flag , clamor for photographs with a visiting American official , and celebrate the United States as both savior and model . Repaying European Support in Afghanistan Reports of the White House debate over whether to join the Paris and London-led war party show that the Obama administration has been a reluctant participant from the start . One reason that the administration overcame its reluctance was to maintain the limited support that European NATO allies have provided to the International Security Assistance Force in Afghanistan . To repay them for their cooperation in the Hindu-Kush , the United States was compelled to support those European allies in North Africa . In explaining why the United States was intervening in a country that was not a vital interest , Secretary of State Hillary Clinton admitted in late March : We asked our allies , our NATO allies , to go into Afghanistan with us ten years ago . They have been there and a lot of them have been there despite the fact they were not attacked They stuck with us . When it comes to Libya , we started hearing from the U.K. , France , Italy , other of our NATO allies . This was in their vital national interests . This rationale has endured , with Secretary Gates acknowledging last week : What was going on in Libya was considered a vital interest by some of our closest allies . Those are the same allies that have come to our support and assistance in Afghanistan . And so it seems to me the kind of limited measured role that the president decided on in support of our allies , who did consider it a vital interest , is a legitimate way to look at this problem . Or , as Senators Joe Lieberman and Marco Rubio wrote yesterday : American disengagement would also inflict irreparable damage on the NATO alliance Having walked out on our European allies in the middle of a battle , we can expect them to do the same to us in Afghanistan . It Will Be a Piece of Cake A final proposition put forward by intervention proponents was that , ultimately , it would not be very hard to achieve the desired end state . Whether based on recent technological advances or the fragile nature of loyalist security forces , such best-case scenario thinking was evident on both sides of the Atlantic .

Earlier , Muammar Gaddafi 's forces unleashed mortar rounds , tank fire and artillery shells on the western city of Misrata on as a French minister said NATO air strikes in Libya risked getting `` bogged down . '' Misrata , Libya 's third city , rose up with other towns against Muammar Gaddafi 's rule in mid-February , and it is now under attack by government troops after a violent crackdown put an end to most protests elsewhere in the west of the country . Rebels are angry at what they perceive to be a scaling back of operations since NATO took over an air campaign , following an early onslaught led by the United States , France and Britain that at one stage tilted the war in the rebels ' favor . French Foreign Minister Alain Juppe said Gaddafi forces were making it harder for alliance pilots to distinguish them from civilians by hunkering down in populated areas . `` The situation is unclear . There is a risk of getting bogged down , '' he said . Juppe told France Info radio he would address the issue of tactics shortly with the head of NATO , adding Misrata 's ordeal `` can not go on . '' NATO has accused Gaddafi of using human shields to make targeting harder for its warplanes . Civil war in the vast North African desert oil producer ignited in February when Gaddafi tried to crush pro-democracy rallies against his 41-year rule inspired by uprisings that have toppled or endangered other autocrats across the Arab world . Stalemate on the battlefield in eastern Libya , defections from Gaddafi 's coterie and the plight of civilians ensnared in fighting or running out of food and fuel has spurred a flurry of diplomacy in pursuit of a peaceful solution . But such efforts have made little headway , with the rebels adamant that Gaddafi step down while the government , aware of the limitations of Western intervention , has offered concessions hinting at democratization but insists he stay in power . In a blow to rebel finances , Gaddafi forces halted production at rebel-held oilfields in eastern Libya , a rebel spokesman said on Wednesday . Rebels want to resume exports to raise revenue for their uprising . Oilfields in Misla and the Waha area were hit by Gaddafi 's artillery on Tuesday and Wednesday , spokesman Hafiz Ghoga told reporters in the rebel stronghold of Benghazi . The Liberian-registered tanker Equator sailed from Marsa el Hariga , near Tobruk , on Wednesday apparently with the first cargo of crude sold by rebels since the uprising began in February , shipping sources said . U.N.-mandated air strikes have so far failed to halt attacks by the Libyan army in besieged Misrata , where residents said snipers on rooftops and tanks firing on populated areas of the city have had a devastating effect . `` Gaddafi forces have changed tactics and are using human shields in urban areas , including in Misrata , '' Britain 's Foreign Office said on Wednesday . The head of Libya 's rebel army has condemned NATO for its slowness in ordering air strikes to protect civilians , saying the alliance was `` letting the people of Misrata die every day . '' Juppe said : `` We 've formally requested that there be no collateral damage for the civilian population ... That obviously makes operations more difficult . '' But General Abdel Fattah Younes was adamant that Gaddafi was conducting massacres . `` Day by day people are dying . Hundreds of families are being wiped off the face of the earth . Patience has its limits , '' he said . Asked whether he found NATO 's argument that it is trying to prevent civilian casualties convincing he said : `` No , it 's not convincing at all . NATO has other means . I requested there be combat helicopters like Apaches and Tigers . These damage tanks and armored vehicles with exact precision without harming civilians . '' Libyan officials deny attacking civilians in Misrata , saying they are fighting armed gangs linked to al Qaeda . Accounts from Misrata can not be independently verified as Libyan authorities are not allowing journalists to report freely from there . Rebel criticism has put the Western military alliance on the defensive , particularly over Misrata . Spokeswoman Carmen Romero said that `` the pace of our operations continues unabated . The ambition and the position of our strikes has not changed . '' NATO air strikes are targeting Gaddafi 's military infrastructure but only to protect civilians , not to provide close air support for rebels , much to their dismay , as part of a no-fly zone mandated by the U.N. Security Council . Relieving the siege of Misrata was a NATO priority but alliance officials conceded that Gaddafi 's army was proving a resourceful and elusive target . `` The situation on the ground is constantly evolving . Gaddafi 's forces are changing tactics , using civilian vehicles , hiding tanks in cities such as Misrata and using human shields to hide behind , '' Romero told reporters in Brussels . Misrata on Wednesday faced another heavy bombardment . `` There was firing on three fronts today , the port in the east , the center around Tripoli street and the west of the city . Mortars , tank fire , and artillery were used to shell those areas , '' rebel Abdelsalam said by telephone . `` NATO needs to either launch a serious operation to take out all the heavy armored vehicles , including tanks ... If they do n't want to do this , they should provide us with weapons to do it ourselves . '' Meanwhile , living conditions in Misrata worsened . `` People are panicking , especially women , children and old people . Most people left their homes for safer areas and found refuge with other families , '' Abdelsalam said , adding : `` No fruit and vegetables have been available in Misrata for over 25 days , bread is also difficult to find . People are scared to go out because of the snipers and the indiscriminate shelling . The upper-hand is still with Gaddafi 's forces . '' On the eastern battlefield , Libyan rebels regained ground in a new advance on the oil port of Brega on Wednesday but also accused NATO of inaction hindering their quest to oust Gaddafi . Ill-trained insurgents thrust westwards to the contested port , recovering mostly desert terrain lost in a pell-mell retreat from Gaddafi 's superior firepower the day before . Rebels returning to the tiny outpost of al-Arbaeen , midway between Brega and their frontline town of Ajdabiyah , spoke of rocket duels close to Brega 's port as both sides strived to end a ragged stalemate in the civil war . Rebel Idriss Abdel Karim complained of a lack of NATO support . '' -LRB- Government forces -RRB- are scared of NATO air strikes but NATO does n't bomb anything in the first place , '' he said . `` There have been no air strikes . We hear the sound , but they do n't bomb anything , '' said Hossam Ahmed , another rebel . `` What is NATO waiting for ? We have cities being destroyed . Ras Lanuf , Bin Jawad , Brega , and Gaddafi is destroying Misrata completely , '' said Ajdabiyah resident Said Emburak . Views expressed in the comments do not represent those of Reuters . Younes needs to stop the politics game playing with NATO . Let s look at the facts . NATO , as requested , has taken command for operations in the Libyan theater . Having assumed control it is apparent NATO is interpreting the requirement to protect civilians in a narrower vein to of the coalition ; that is NATO acts where there is an imminent danger to the unarmed civilian population , as opposed to initiating pre-emptive strikes against Qaddafi forces . Regrettably much as the West fears and seeks to avoid civilian deaths it is unavoidable . The truth is that as a rule , in any conflict civilians will die .

How is that your choice of guests to explore painful realities in Africa are both Anglo ? What is more , footage used throughout this piece are visuals of seemingly destitute , Black Africans . This is an affront to critical journalism , and absolutely imbalanced , GPS chase producers need to do better . Is it too much to ask producers to balance this panel out with the presence of scholars , public intellectuals and thought leaders who are indigenous Black Africans ? Peter Godin 's book , and Nicholas Kristof 's trip with students , may lend perspective , but do these acts render either of these men `` authorities '' on a continent - absolutely not . Violence , torture , corruption , crisis in leadership , poverty , and other crimes against humanity , sadly , are pervasive globally . Bad governance is not unique , but the disproportionate attention to Black leaders and their wrong-doing is , and has become its own brand of racism . This segment amounts to a narrative built on biased and lazy journalism . July 10 , 2011 at 11:05 am | Reply oh , Fareed , i am so very disappointed in this week 's show . peter godwin is the epitomy of the hypocrisy that has enveloped parts of Africa over the decades . He rattled on about crimes against humanity in his country of Zimbabwe and about somewhat free municipal elections in South Africa without once asking why no white was ever tried for all of the crimes against humanity committed in both countries over the past few decades . Or why bringing western style democracy has been such a challenge -LRB- i mean , really . if you had been brutalized for decades by whites claiming to be implementing democracy , would you trust them now ? -RRB- Zimbabwe did not get their independence from colonial brutality until when ? And yet into the 1990s 85 % of the fertile , money producing lands were owned by 40 000 whites . That alone is a crime against humanity . And let 's not even talk about South Africa , who didnt come out from under brutal oppression until well into the 1990s . And who has ever been tried in the Hague for the evils that happened there at the hands of the white minorities ? Yet mr. godwin wants to talk about crimes against humanity . It seems to me that he is not yet aware of what that term really means .

For example , you recently highlighted some current issues about Africa , yet you had two caucasions speak on these issues on your program . Surely , you could have found some intelligent people of African\\/Black descent to speak on these issues .

BP Plc launched an ambitious deep sea operation to choke off a gushing oil leak in the Gulf of Mexico on Wednesday , but President Barack Obama cautioned Americans there was no guarantee it would work . -LRB- Reuters -RRB- Thoughts , comments , suggestions or criticisms about The Post 's Live Q&A s ? Send us an e-mail . Thursday , May 27 , 2010 ; 1:00 PM The top kill is underway , success uncertain . BP engineers are pumping mud at a furious rate into the damaged blowout preventer that sits on the uncapped well at the bottom of the Gulf of Mexico . The hazardous-but-high-reward maneuver comes five weeks into the oil spill crisis amid an intensifying atmosphere of political recrimination that has spread from the Gulf Coast to the White House and Congress . Greg McCormack : Hi I am Greg McCormack , Director of the Petroleum Extension Service the University of Texas we are following the activities in the Gulf of Mexico and I am here to explain the Top Kill Operation . Silver Spring , Md. : Soaking up oil : Whenever I am changing my oil in my car I make certain that I have a bucket of sawdust around -LRB- I am a woodworker -RRB- . When I knock over the old oil from my car , I just throw a few scoops of sawdust on it . It is immediately soaked up the oil and then I scoop it up with a dust pan -- problem resolved . There are millions of cubic yards of sawdust available from lumber mills , furniture makers , etc. . Has anybody suggested this . If interested , I can demonstrate or just try it yourself . This oil\\/sawdust could be disposed of by incinerating or easily hauled away . Denver , Colo. : I 'm trying to understand the logic behind the complaints that BP is n't doing enough . This is such a major PR disaster for them -- their name is going to be associated with Oil Spill for decades to come , like Exxon . What possible business reason would there be for them not to be doing everything possible to stop the leak and clean stuff up ? Baltimore , Md. : I find it a bit amusing that once it was announced that the `` top kill '' had worked , all the live camera feeds that a multitude of Web sites were showing live , suddenly ceased . At least I ca n't find one anywhere to save my soul . So what is this : some `` conspiracy '' to divert attention from what could be an incomplete success , or just a stupid media mindset of `` no drama ? Nothing to see here , move along , folks ... '' ???? Greg McCormack : There are multiple web sites showing the live feed . Because it is streaming they occasionally go down or stop showing the video . Downingtown , Pa. : I 'm unclear on how extensive the cement plug will be . Will it extend from near the sea floor to deep below ? Or will it be at the base of the drill casing and extend upward ? Perhaps a related question : How significant is the risk that hydrocarbons will bypass the plug and find a way to the sea floor ? Newport Beach , Calif. : Why are U.S. deep water drillers not required to drill a relief well at the same time the drill the initial well ? I understand this is a requirement in other countries including Canada . Would n't that have prevented much of this disaster ? Bowie , Md. : Without human intervention , what will ultimately happen to the oil that 's been spilled ? Will it eventually evaporate ; dissolve ; sink to the bottom ? Laurel , Md. : The United Kingdom produces a lot of petroleum from the North Sea . Is it BP doing that , too ? If their environmental practices are consistent , is that region at as much risk as our Gulf ? Arlington , Va. : It sounds to me like BP is just grasping at straws . They want to appear to be doing something , but they really know that the oil is going to continue to flow for several more months until the alternate well is drilled . Rockville , Md. : Our popular image of a land-based oil well is that it starts with a gusher spraying out the top of a rig . How are offshore wells initially dug in order not to leak in the first place ? Brooklyn , N.Y. : One thing I have never understood about the spill is that it is apparently an ` exploratory ' well . It seems to be an awful lot of oil for a non-production well . Did they just hit too much oil that had more pressure than the well could handle ? If this were a full production well that had ruptured how much worse would the disaster be ? Arlington , Va. : In the news you often read that the cement would plug the well `` permanently . '' How permanent is `` permanently '' ? Wo n't the cement crack and deteriorate over time just like with any structure ? Are there any long-range estimates of how long this plug is designed to last ? Washington , D.C. : What do you think about President Obama 's halt to offshore drilling for six months ? Does offshore drilling have a future ? If not , where do we get the oil ? Arlington , Va. : What happened to 4-story cofferdam they tried lowering over the leak originally ? Is it going to be left on the seafloor or did they raise it back up and recover it ? Palo Alto , Calif. : A little technical information is always interesting , and your guesses would be nice if you lack the actual data : What was the pressure at the wellhead prior to the start of the top kill , what pressure might have been imposed by the kill mud pumping , and what flow rates down hole might have been achieved in the first hour , and then say at hour 12 ? Centreville , Va. : Mr. McCormack , it has been widely reported that for the northern drilling Canada does require a relief well be drilled simultaneously with the production well . The reason this is n't going to cause a 2nd blowout is that the relief well taps into the original well drill hole and plugs it . The relief well does n't actually drill into the oil reservoir . Willis , Mont. : Why are n't they using a compound like drylock fastplug ? It will solidify under water . Metairie , La. : Why would BP , realizing this is an unprecedented disaster with an unprecedented need , not go outside of their company to have a national summit -- to confer with the top engineers of the country -LRB- even competitors like Chevron , Shell , etc. -RRB- to help solve this issue and work for the good of the whole industry ? Washington , D.C. : Hi Greg , my question is could this attempt to plug the well with mud have been done at the start ? I do n't know whether it 's true , but I 've heard that BP avoided it because they wanted to have the well available to them again in the future and did n't want to lose a moneymaker , so they tried other ways first . In that case , they 've been looking out for their interests instead of the country 's , and that 's when the government should have forced them to action on this earlier . Your thoughts on that ? Houston , Tex. : If the professionals do not know to fix this , why do people think blaming Obama will help ? Does the president have some skills here beyond what the pros have ? Hook 'em : The technical challenges that BP are faced with today have never been faced with before . Panama City , Fla. : I 'm curious about what we see continuing to escape the riser ?

Is this possible , or have I just read too many science fiction books ? Synte Peacock : How bad it will get will depend on the total amount of oil released . It 's unclear now how much this will be . Our results are formulated not to depend on this number . Instead , we report results in terms of a dilution factor . -LRB- see the NCAR URL for details : Ocean currents likely to carry oil along Atlantic coast -LRB- UCAR -RRB- -RRB- Worried about the Keys : I have gone to the Florida Keys many times with my family , from here in the D.C. area . We tow our small center-console boat down and enjoy boating , fishing , and scuba diving , keeping the boat docked at our hotel . I love the Keys . As you can imagine , I am now feeling very worried , sad , and anxious about what may happen to all the people down there , the reefs , and the fish , even though they are okay so far . How likely is it that the BP oil spill will damage this fun , beautiful , but delicate area , which includes the nation 's only underwater national park and a lot of protected coral reefs ? I know you do n't have a crystal ball but I do n't have any sense of the probabilities at this point . Synte Peacock : If and when the oil gets caught in the Loop Current , and fed to the Florida Current , it is possible that the Keys will be affected . But the impact on reefs and fish and coastlines will depend both on local winds and ocean currents -LRB- that we ca n't predict more than a few days into the future -- as others are trying to do -RRB- and of course on the total amount of oil released . Fairfax , Va. : People were saying on the news that some reports said the spill could reach Europe . How long would that take ? Florida coast : I have vacation plans on the Panhandle in two weeks -- do you think I should cancel\\/resked ? Washington , D.C. : Over time , will the damage the oil causes reduce itself ? In other words , will the oil become less dense , less thick and even out and not be such a danger to wildlife and the environment ? Have you seen the pictures of pelicans this morning ? It 's really disturbing . Synte Peacock : Our understanding that there will be significant dilution of the oil as time goes by , and this undoubtedly will help . How long it will take until the oil concentrations cease to be a danger to wildlife is something we do have an answer to at the moment . Arlington , Va. : The conservative take on the spill has been that the sun and the surf will break down the oil fairly quickly and this wo n't be a problem in a few months -- is that really the case ? Synte Peacock : What we 've shown with our simulations is that the currents can potentially move the oil very fast very fast , even out into the interior Atlantic within a few months . So if it does n't break down on this timescale , there could be widespread impacts . It would really help to have firm numbers on the timescale over which this oil can break down , but we do n't know that . Washington , D.C. : I do n't know if this is your area but let me ask . What 's keeping the oil coming ? Is there any chance it will stop on its own ? Where is all the pressure coming from ? And does n't the fact that it 's so far down in the ocean floor with so much water above pressing down , I ca n't imagine how much force the gushing has . Can you enlighten us ? Synte Peacock : This is a question for geologists . But you are right , it is internal pressures that are keeping it flowing . Washington , D.C. : Will the oil eventually rinse out of the water ? When you say `` over time , '' how much time would it take ? Crimping : Earlier this week , I think it was Bill Nye who mentioned that crimping and bending was n't a viable option . The metal pipe is too brittle and would crack into pieces rather than crimp together . Synte Peacock : Thanks very much ! Washington , D.C. : By rinse , I mean become diluted and therefore less harmful , poisonous . Synte Peacock : Yes , with time the oil will become more diluted . We have modeled the effects of dilution due to ocean currents and stirring , and our simulations show that the oil becomes significantly more diluted as it is transported further from the source . By the time the oil reaches the interior Atlantic in our simulations , we estimate that it will be roughly 2000 more dilute than it is at the source . Annandale , Va. : Can you explain how the tides affect the flow of oil ? Is the gulf pretty calm ? Is most of the oil staying there ? How much of a threat is there that it will spread worldwide or at least way beyond the Gulf ? Synte Peacock : We find that it is very likely that on a timescale of months -LRB- not years -RRB- , the oil will spread far beyond the Gulf . Note that it is likely to be much more dilute than it is at the spill site by the time it reaches the Atlantic . We have avoided trying to model near-shore processes such as tides and local winds because we do n't know what the winds will be weeks to months from now . San Diego , Calif. : They say they are now siphoning oil into tankers . How much will this impact the containment of the oil ? Or is this just a thumb in the `` Dutchman 's dike wall '' ? Synte Peacock : The more that is siphoned , the less will enter the Atlantic , and the less that has to be contained from hitting the coast . Bel Air , Md. : Can you basically explain the Loop Current in simple terms and how it will affect the spread of the oil spill ? Synte Peacock : Yes ! The Loop Current is part of the persistent ocean Western boundary current system -LRB- which includes the Gulf Stream -RRB- . But the Loop Current is unique because there is no coast between Yucatan and Florida , and so it forms a clockwise loop which protrudes into the Gulf . The Loop Current is quite chaotic and unpredictable .

Do they prefer the MBA-style of President Bush , who delegated management of the economic crisis to Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson until he could not avoid a prime-time address to the nation , and then warned of dire consequences if the government does not act ? Do they prefer the brashness of John McCain , who on Tuesday talked as if he were prepared to scuttle a deal on a rescue package and then on Wednesday abruptly suspended his campaign and elbowed his way into the middle of things in an effort to galvanize negotiators to reach a solution ? Do they prefer the cool and reserved style of Barack Obama , who has monitored the crisis without interrupting his campaign , offered guidelines for what would be an acceptable deal , but who has seemed willing to let the process in Washington play out without direct intervention on his part ? What was clear from the start of the general election was the wide philosophical gulf between Obama and McCain . On virtually every issue , from Iraq to taxes to health care to energy , the differences in their views were stark . Voters could see that the outcome of the election would have a profound impact on the direction the next president would try to take the country . But over the course of the past week , it 's become equally clear that there is a significant difference between McCain and Obama in their leadership styles . Those differences have been on display over the past few days , especially during the chaotic and unexpected developments on Wednesday that produced Thursday 's White House meeting , with McCain and Obama in attendance . McCain , speaking Thursday morning at the Clinton Global Initiative in New York before returning to Washington , called for Democrats and Republicans to set aside politics and solve the crisis now . But both campaigns understand the very obvious political implications of the drama unfolding around the negotiating tables in the capital and along the campaign trail . Voters are gaining new insights into how these two nominees might act if they were actually in the White House . The presidential debates are intended to provided side-by-side comparisons of the two candidates and presumably they will go forward , if not exactly on schedule . But the financial crisis provides a real-time laboratory for understanding the approaches of the two nominees . Obama has been more measured and less passionate . McCain , since declaring the fundamentals of the economy strong in his first utterance , has been increasingly outspoken . Obama has blamed the policies and philosophy of the Republicans for allowing the innate greed of Wall Street to run amok . McCain has blamed greed and corruption itself . McCain has seen the crisis in terms of good and evil -- well , mostly evil . Obama has looked at systemic causes . McCain asked for heads to roll . Obama argued that a change in administrations is the real solution . Neither can be seen as an obstacle to a solution , but has either truly contributed to a one ? Obama advisers argue that their candidate worked cooperatively with Paulson as the administration was preparing its rescue plan and with congressional Democrats in formulating objections to what the initial package included . That , they say , has helped push both sides closer to resolution . McCain 's actions have certainly appeared more impetuous . Was it necessary to declare his campaign in suspension and recommend a postponement of Friday 's debate to get the attention of the president and the negotiators ? With congressional Republicans moving to oppose the package , his advisers would argue that only a forceful intervention could produce a package acceptable enough to pass . Obama 's moves have drawn less direct criticism , though McCain and the Republicans have argued that he has been unwilling to commit himself at key points over the past 10 days -- a charge Obama 's advisers reject . Ironically , Obama and McCain are now very close together on the terms of a deal . In this case , policy differences appear minimal . Both want independent oversight of how the Treasury secretary would buy up and then resell devalued securities . Both want the taxpayers to share in any profits . Both want Wall Street executives not to profit excessively . Both say the rescue package should be a first step toward revamping the regulation of the financial industry . But the two are now playing brinksmanship over the crisis , with McCain calling for a delay in Friday 's presidential debate until there is agreement on a package and Obama arguing there is no need to stop all campaign activity . Speaking by satellite to the Clinton global forum after McCain , Obama said he would go to Washington Thursday to meet with McCain and others at the White House , but vowed to be in Oxford , Miss. , on Friday night for the debate . McCain has certainly taken the bigger risk , but Obama 's course is not risk-free . These events are yet to play out , but the public will have plenty to judge these two nominees on by the time the weekend is over . These are not two politicians who would operate out of the Oval Office in similar ways . Philosophically , stylistically and temperamentally , Americans have a real choice in November . By Web Politics Editor | September 25 , 2008 ; 11:19 AM ET Well it looks like McCain is going to debate . So I suggest you liberals start crossing whatever you have , come Monday morning there will be a huge swing in the polls . Obama needs to call in sick if he can there is no way he can debate with McCain Posted by : mthomps71 | September 26 , 2008 11:57 AM | Report abuse I see the presidential debate and the financial crisis as two independent things . Though the financial crisis is of the at most importance , it ca n't be solved by McCain or Obama . There is a whole gang of senators , congressmen , and financial heavyweights in Washington who can do all the work needed to solve the problem without McCain 's presence . In fact McCain is not even in any of the committee 's that are involved in solving the crisis . How does McCain 's canceling the debate change what is happening in Washington . The only reason McCain is doing it is to shine the spotlight on himself . He is no more than a McChicken . It is very clea that he is not able to articulate a position for what he wants out of this mess . So his position is wait for another week , and talk about it only after the bill has passed . Because Obama is a fraud . With friends like Hastings who today said about Palin : `` If Sarah Palin isn t enough of a reason for you to get over whatever your problem is with Barack Obama , then you damn well had better pay attention , '' said Hastings . `` Anybody toting guns and stripping moose don t care too much about what they do with Jews and blacks . So , you just think this through . '' `` Hastings , who is a member of the Congressional Black Caucus , made his comments in Washington , D.C. , while participating in a panel discussion sponsored by the National Jewish Democratic Council . '' Black leaders like Hastings , Obama and Wright have a lot of class . `` Under the plan , disclosed at a Congressional hearing today , a new agency would be created within the Treasury Department to assume supervision of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , the government-sponsored companies that are the two largest players in the mortgage lending industry . `` Significant details must still be worked out before Congress can approve a bill . Among the groups denouncing the proposal today were the National Association of Home Builders and Congressional Democrats who fear that tighter regulation of the companies could sharply reduce their commitment to financing low-income and affordable housing . '' These two entities -- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac -- are not facing any kind of financial crisis , '' said Representative Barney Frank of Massachusetts , the ranking Democrat on the Financial Services Committee .

But whether he can - or will - put US interests to one side remains to be seen Friday 1 April 2005 00.03 BST For opponents of America 's war on Iraq and fans of Michael Moore , one of the most indelible moments of the film Fahrenheit 9\\/11 is when Paul Wolfowitz , deputy defense secretary and the intellectual high priest of the Bush administration 's hawks , puts a generous dollop of spit on his comb before smoothing his hair for a television appearance . Iffy grooming habits are the least of Wolfowitz 's worries as he takes on the presidency of the World Bank . His coronation yesterday was never seriously in doubt - the US is the bank 's largest shareholder . But whether he can put US interests to one side remains to be seen . And , after a lifetime spent trying to expand America 's power , is he capable of functioning in a multilateral environment where the focus will not be Washington 's strategic interest , but global poverty ? In the fortnight since his nomination , Wolfowitz has worked strenuously to try to temper his reputation as a raging neo-conservative , deploying his not inconsiderable charm to persuade critics in Europe and the Middle East that he does indeed have experience in finance and development , and that he will be able to divorce Washington 's interests from the bank 's . Many will prove impossible to convince , seeing in Wolfowitz 's appointment evidence of the White House 's intent to use the World Bank to advance US global interests . `` It 's a slap in the face , it 's a poke in the eye . It 's bad for the international community in general , and particularly for people already pushed to the brink in poor and marginalised communities , '' says Emira Woods , a fellow at the left-leaning Institute for Policy Studies . `` What this means is that the person who was the architect of the corporate-driven plan for Iraq that failed now gets a chance to do that in the rest of the world . '' Others believe that Wolfowitz , seen as the intellectual force among the administration 's neo-conservatives , was always an uneasy fit at the Pentagon . `` When he was named deputy of secretary of defense I thought of a number of positions where he would be even more in tune with what was going on , '' says Thomas Keaney , a defense expert who worked with Wolfowitz during one of his brief spells out of government at the School of Advanced International Studies at Johns Hopkins University . `` I thought he was even more in tune with international development and globalisation . This is a good fit . '' It is also a welcome escape for Wolfowitz , who has spent much of the past two years trying to defend his policies to Congress . The academic high priest of the Vulcans , as the president 's coterie of security advisers called themselves , Wolfowitz is associated inextricably with the greatest disasters of the Iraq war : the rosy predictions on the eve of the conflict that US soldiers would be welcomed with open arms as liberators , and his insistence that reconstruction could be financed from Iraqi oil revenues . `` I think he and the Bush White House have slightly different agendas . The Bush White House wanted to promote and reward a guy without going through - though they would never say this - a bruising confirmation battle for some other US government job , '' says James Mann , the author of a history of the Bush war cabinet called Rise of the Vulcans . `` He sees it as a chance to launch into an entirely new area , and to get away from being stuck on defense and military issues . '' Now 61 , Wolfowitz was born into a Polish Jewish immigrant family , and grew up mainly in the university town of Ithaca , New York , where his father was a professor of statistical theory at Cornell University . At 14 he spent a year in Israel while his father was a visiting professor in Haifa , and his sister emigrated to the country . But he is one of the few neo-conservatives in the Bush administration to endorse the creation of a Palestinian state , and was heckled at a pro-Israeli rally in 2002 for acknowledging Palestinian suffering . To please his father , the younger Wolfowitz enrolled at Cornell , too , where he studied maths and was offered a full scholarship , but went on to pursue his own interests in political science , doing graduate studies at the University of Chicago . There he encountered such leading conservative figures as Leo Strauss and Albert Wohlstetter , under whom he wrote his doctorate on the dangers of a nuclearised Middle East . Significantly for a neo-conservative , that included the threat posed by a nuclear-armed Israel . Since coming to Washington to work as an intern in the arms control and disarmament agency in 1973 , Wolfowitz has worked almost exclusively in government , apart from a period of exile during the Clinton years , when he headed the School of Advanced International Studies . Even colleagues who disagree violently with his view of the world concede that Wolfowitz was far more congenial than the usual Washington apparatchik . `` He does n't do what I have often seen in Washington which is treat you like a piece of furniture , '' says Dan Gour , a fellow at the Lexington Institute , who met Wolfowitz 30 years ago when he gave him a job at the arms control agency . `` Even if he was critical of something you had done for him , it was not done in a way that would diminish you as an individual . '' But despite sharp intelligence , willingness to put in 18-hour work days , and a genial , low-key manner , Wolfowitz has never before held a leadership position . Instead , he became `` the most influential underling in Washington '' , as Mann writes in his book . Over the years he worked under six presidents , including the Democrat , Jimmy Carter . But Wolfowitz 's preoccupations have not radically changed since his days as a graduate student : a belief in the importance of military power and that America is a force for good in the world , a distrust of the Soviet Union and of America 's intelligence agencies , and a disdain for the Kissinger doctrines of detente and containment . Since 2001 Wolfowitz has added another pillar to his ideology : a belief that the September 11 terror attacks changed the world forever . Clues to the way in which Wolfowitz would respond to that change as deputy Pentagon chief were evident from his first days in Washington . As a junior official at the Pentagon in 1977 he presided over a project which looked at the possibility of a Soviet seizure of Gulf oilfields . He also explored the consequences of an Iraqi attack on Saudi Arabia or Kuwait . To Mann , that was typical . `` He stands out for me from many other neo-conservatives for the frequency with which he takes core beliefs and then asks the next question , '' he says . During the 80s , Wolfowitz 's interests shifted from the Middle East to Asia , when he moved to the state department as assistant secretary for east Asia , then ambassador to Indonesia . Supporters say those years convinced him of the importance of using American might to promote democratic change . He was , by all accounts , a successful ambassador . But some who acknowledge his popularity also discount the argument that Wolfowitz used his influence as an envoy to press for change . `` It is really too much to claim that he played any kind of role in leading Indonesia to democracy , '' says Jeffrey Winters , an expert on Indonesia at Chicago 's Northwestern University , who was in the country at the time . `` The real record when you dig into it is that he was very slow to respond to Indonesia 's movement for democracy . Indonesia 's citizens across the spectrum had been struggling against authoritarian rule . They had been tortured . They had been jailed . They had been ruined in various ways , and the Wolfowitz embassy did n't speak up for them - not once .

CARL AZUZ , CNN STUDENT NEWS ANCHOR : Hey , and thank you for joining us ! I 'm Carl Azuz , launching you into CNN Student News ! If you were with us last week , it 's great to have you back . If this is your first day , welcome to our 2011-2012 coverage . We 're starting with a new conflict in Libya . This conflict started months ago . Longtime leader Moammar Gadhafi and his forces are fighting against rebels who want Gadhafi out . Other countries are involved in this , too , as part of a NATO mission to protect Libya 's civilians . There were reports that hundreds of people were killed yesterday during fighting in and around the Libyan capital , Tripoli . The rebels say they 're making significant progress , advancing toward Gadhafi 's headquarters . But the Libyan government says the rebels are losing every battle . Colonel Gadhafi went on the radio Sunday , urging his supporters to continue their fight . A CNN crew that 's been in Libya for weeks said this weekend 's fighting in Tripoli seemed to be the most intense fighting yet in the capital city . AZUZ : Violence increasing in another conflict , meanwhile , this one in the Middle East . It started with a series of attacks on Israeli civilians and soldiers on Thursday , and it 's turned into days of fighting between Israelis and Palestinians . These two groups have clashed for decades . And two regions -- Gaza and the West Bank -- have traditionally been at the center of those clashes . At least eight Israelis were killed in the attacks on Thursday . Israel then launched air strikes against what it called `` terrorist targets '' in Gaza . And in response , say Israeli officials , around 100 rockets have been fired into Israel . You can see some of the damage from those in this video . Israel 's government says it will respond to any attempt to harm Israeli civilians or soldiers . Palestinian officials are urging Israel to stop what it calls the `` unjustified aggression '' against the Palestinians in Gaza . STAN CASE , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Is this legit ? Storms in the Atlantic Ocean are given names when they become hurricanes . They get names when they are classified as tropical storms , which is one level below a hurricane . AZUZ : The 9th storm to get a name might be the first hurricane of the 2011 Atlantic season . Forecasters predict that Tropical Storm Irene is picking up strength as it moves toward islands in the Caribbean Sea . On Sunday afternoon , Irene had wind speeds around 50 miles per hour . Wo n't be considered a hurricane until those wind speeds reach 74 miles per hour . Experts think that could happen very soon . Officials announced hurricane warnings for Puerto Rico and the Dominican Republic yesterday . Some predictions estimated that Irene could dump up to 20 inches of rain on parts of the Dominican Republic . There 's concern that heavy rain could trigger mudslides there ; that has happened before . AZUZ : Vice President Joe Biden has finished a trip to China . But this was the scene when he arrived in the country last Wednesday . He was there for five days meeting with Chinese leaders , and the biggest issue discussed during his visit was the U.S. economy . China has bought more U.S. debt that any other foreign country . So , officials there are concerned about America 's ability to manage that debt . During one speech , Vice President Biden explained why it 's important for the U.S. to protect Chinese and American investors . U.S. VICE PRESIDENT JOE BIDEN : I read that some Chinese are concerned about your safety of your investments in American assets . But please understand no one cares more about this than we do , since Americans own 87 % of all our financial assets and 69 % of all our treasury bonds , while China owns 1 % of our financial assets and 8 % of our treasury bills , respectively . AZUZ : All right , shifting gears now . About 1.6 billion people -- just over a fifth of the world 's population -- are Muslim . And we 're in the middle of the most sacred time on the Muslim calendar . It 's called Ramadan , and it lasts for an entire month . Although there are disagreements about when exactly that month starts . Dan Gilgoff explains that -- and more -- about this observance . DAN GILGOFF , CNN.COM RELIGION EDITOR : Ramadan is the Islamic month of fasting . It 's meant to be a month of reflection , prayer and charity , detachment from worldly affairs . A month of purification . It 's one of the 5 pillars , or duties , of Islam . Ramadan is believed to be the month during which the prophet Mohammed started receiving the divine revelation , the Quran , or the Muslim holy book , from God , or Allah . And so , the most holy night during Ramadan -- and of the entire Islamic year -- is called the night of power , and that 's the night which it is believed that Allah did start to reveal the text of the Quran to the prophet Mohammed in the year 610 . Ramadan is the ninth month of the Islamic calendar . And the Islamic calendar operates according to the lunar cycle , the cycle of the moon . And so every year , Ramadan moves up around 11 days earlier than the previous year . It 's supposed to begin with the sighting of the first new moon of that cycle . And every year , there are debates about when that first new moon becomes visible , so that various countries believe that they see the first new moon on various days and Ramadan will begin on different days in different countries . The fast is broken each night with what 's called the iftar meal , and it 's a meal that 's often times communal or banquet-style meal that 's eaten in a mosque . The fast each night is often broken with dates , which is believed to have dated to the time of Mohammed . Every year during Ramadan the international sale of dates just skyrockets . The month of Ramadan ends with the holiday called Eid ul-Fitr . It 's often simply just referred to as Eid . It is the start of the next lunar month after Ramadan . It 's a break the fast holiday that 's marked by a lot of celebrations and feasting with friends and families . A lot of mosques hold carnivals for a couple of days after Ramadan ends . TOMEKA JONES , CNN STUDENT NEWS : Time for the Shoutout ! What historic figure once said , `` out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope '' ? If you think you know it , shout it out ! Was it : A -RRB- Queen Elizabeth II , B -RRB- Martin Luther King Jr. , C -RRB- John F. Kennedy or D -RRB- Mahatma Gandhi ? You 've got three seconds -- GO ! That phrase was part of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. 's famous `` I Have a Dream '' speech in 1963 . That 's your answer and that 's your Shoutout ! AZUZ : When Dr. King gave that speech , he was standing on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial . Now , the civil rights leader will have his own memorial in the nation 's capital . The dedication ceremony being scheduled for next week . But we 've got a little virtual tour for you right now . The entrance , with the two stones that have been separated , is meant to symbolize the mountain of despair that Doctor King was talking about . And the single boulder inside is meant to be the stone of hope . There 's also an inscription wall inside the memorial featuring more than a dozen of Dr. Martin Luther King 's most famous quotations . AZUZ : Dr. King will join the other famous Americans who have memorials in Washington , D.C. . The question we 're asking on our blog is who else do you think should be honored with a national memorial ?

But do n't worry ... not yet , anyway Out of 30,000 global cases , only 145 deaths have been reported and development of a vaccine is well under way . But scientists will not relax : the virus could mutate and grow stronger over the summer - and what happens if it mixes with bird flu ? It was the final surge in numbers that forced the World Health Organisation to act . With confirmation last week that swine flu cases had risen above 1,000 in Australia , it was clear the disease was now spreading freely around the world . Thousands of cases had already been reported in the United States , Mexico and Chile . Officials at the World Health Organisation simply had no choice . On Thursday , they announced swine flu had achieved pandemic status , the first strain of influenza to reach this mark for 41 years . It seems an alarming prospect . Are we again set to face a disease that can kill millions as happened with the pandemics of 1918 , 1957 and 1968 ? Margaret Chan , the World Health Organisation 's director general , was confident , however . The disease is only a `` moderately severe '' risk , she announced . Out of 30,000 cases worldwide , only 145 deaths have been reported . Development of a vaccine - the world 's main anti-flu weapon - is already under way while stockpiles of anti-viral drugs such as Tamiflu are also available , at least for developed nations . It would be premature to assume complete security , however . Before the world vanquishes swine flu , many hurdles will have to be cleared . In particular , every stage of the development of a swine flu vaccine , our key hope of fighting the disease , could be disrupted , scientists warned last week . `` We must be prepared for something that is more severe than is currently observed , '' said Dr Alan Hay , director of the World Influenza Centre , in London . `` We can not be complacent . '' For a start , swine flu vaccine production is still at a very early stage . Indeed , the artificial strain that will form the core of a vaccine has only just been created , with researchers in Britain , Australia and the US having produced almost identical versions . These have only just been passed to pharmaceutical firms to see if they can quickly produce the vaccine on a mass scale . The British version of the vaccine strain - known as RG121 - was created two weeks ago at the National Institute for Biological Standards Control near London . Like its US and Australian counterparts , it is made of bits of several flu viruses but specifically stimulates immunity against swine flu . Unlike swine flu , however , it can be grown easily in hens ' eggs . Eggs are used throughout the drugs industry as incubators in which viruses - the basic components of vaccines - are grown . `` Hens ' eggs remain the bulwark for vaccine production , '' said Professor Peter Dunnill , of the Centre for Biochemical Engineering at University College London . `` It is a pretty ponderous business , however . Each egg has to be looked after carefully and you have to beware lest infections kill them off . '' This point was backed by Dr James Robertson , leader of the team that created the RG121 strain . `` Different strains behave differently in eggs and produce varying amounts of virus particles . In the case of our swine flu vaccine strain , we simply do not know yet how much virus you will get from each egg , At present , pharmaceutical companies ' estimates of the amounts of virus particles they will get from their eggs are optimistic . This could be a mistake , warn scientists , and companies could find they get less than a third or a quarter as many viral particles as they hoped for , a reduction that would , in turn , limit the number of vaccine doses available to the public . Once viruses are extracted from eggs they are broken into pieces including bits of their protein coats . These protein pieces are important because they stimulate immune responses in humans and can be used to make a vaccine . `` Coat proteins raise antibodies in the blood so that a person , coming across the real live virus , will be prepared to launch an immune attack against it , '' said Robertson . But sometimes , it takes more than one dose of a vaccine to stimulate full protection . The current seasonal flu vaccine requires only a single shot but other vaccines require two inoculations , a point stressed by Dr Hay . `` It may require two doses to provide significant immunity against swine flu , '' he told the Observer . And if a swine flu vaccine requires a double dose , this would also limit numbers of doses available to provide full protection as quickly as possible . Even if viral production in eggs goes to plan , manufacturers such as GlaxoSmithKline will be stretched to meet demands and have decided to add chemicals known as adjuvants to their vaccines . Adjuvants stimulate immune systems and so reduce amounts of vaccine needed to create antibody protection in an individual . `` We will be using adjuvants in our vaccines , '' said Stephen Rae of GlaxoSmithKline . `` This will be the first time we have used them for a flu vaccine but we are confident they will work . '' However , Professor Dunnill again warned that care should be taken with such predictions . `` It remains to be seen if pharmaceuticals can rely on using adjuvants and still produce a single dose vaccine against swine flu , '' he said . And then there is the issue of timing . At present , only a limited number of people have succumbed to swine flu in the UK with the Health Protection Agency putting the figure at 1,121 confirmed cases yesterday . But most scientists now predict a second wave of the disease is likely to strike later in the year . Exactly when and how it hits will have profound consequences for Britain , as Hay explained . `` The key issue is how the virus mutates in the southern hemisphere over the next few months during the winter there . That is far more important than its behavior in the northern hemisphere during our spring and summer . '' The virus is more likely to spread through populations during the southern hemisphere in winter and the more it does so , the more it is likely to mutate , possibly into a new , more virulent form . There is also the issue of the timing of that return . If a reinvigorated , more virulent forms appears late in the year , health and pharmaceutical workers could have enough time to prepare reasonable supplies of vaccine . `` However , if it returns earlier in the year , in September , say , there is not much chance we will have enough vaccine ready by then , '' Dr Hay warned . `` It is undoubtedly a problem . Certainly , there is no doubt the big issue here is time . '' Should vaccine supplies be low when the second wave strikes , health workers will then face a problem of deciding which members of the public should be rated as priority targets . Health and utility workers , police and security staff , will be obvious choices . But selecting the elderly - a key choice for seasonal flu vaccine - as priorities for swine flu vaccines would be a mistake , Hay said . `` Around 75 per cent of people who have succumbed to swine flu have been under age of 30 and very few have been over 60 . It is very likely that people of 60 and above may well have some immunity . '' Intriguingly swine flu is of the same basic type , called H1N1 , as the virus that caused the 1918 pandemic , the world 's worst outbreak of flu which killed up to 100 million people across the globe . `` That basic strain circulated round the world for another four decades until 1957 when it was replaced by a new type , known as H2N2 , which was responsible for the Asian flu epidemic of that year , '' Hay said . In other words , people who were children or young adults before 1957 may well be carrying immune protection to an old virus that is a distant descendant", "prop_label_1": "Loaded_Language", "prop_txt_1": "Swine flu is now a pandemic, but don't worry...
